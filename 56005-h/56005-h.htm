I.</span></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Marsena Pulford</span>, what time the village
of Octavius knew him, was a slender
and tall man, apparently skirting upon the
thirties, with sloping shoulders and a romantic
aspect.</p>

<p>It was not alone his flowing black hair, and
his broad shirt-collars turned down after the ascertained
manner of the British poets, which
stamped him in our humble minds as a living
brother to "The Corsair," "The Last of the
Suliotes," and other heroic personages engraved
in the albums and keepsakes of the period.
His face, with its darkling eyes and distinguished
features, conveyed wherever it went
an impression of proudly silent melancholy.
In those days&mdash;that is, just before the war&mdash;one
could not look so convincingly and uniformly
sad as Marsena did without raising the
general presumption of having been crossed in
love. We had a respectful feeling, in his case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
that the lady ought to have been named I&ntilde;ez,
or at the very least Oriana.</p>

<p>Although he went to the Presbyterian
Church with entire regularity, was never seen
in public save in a long-tailed black coat, and
in the winter wore gloves instead of mittens,
the local conscience had always, I think, sundry
reservations about the moral character of
his past. It would not have been reckoned
against him, then, that he was obviously poor.
We had not learned in those primitive times to
measure people by dollar-mark standards. Under
ordinary conditions, too, the fact that he
came from New England&mdash;had indeed lived in
Boston&mdash;must have counted rather in his favor
than otherwise. But it was known that he had
been an artist, a professional painter of pictures
and portraits, and we understood in Octavius
that this involved acquaintanceship, if not even
familiarity, with all sorts of occult and deleterious
phases of city life.</p>

<p>Our village held all vice, and especially the
vice of other and larger places, in stern reprobation.
Yet, though it turned this matter
of the newcomer's previous occupation over a
good deal in its mind, Marsena carried himself
with such a gentle picturesqueness of subdued
sorrow that these suspicions were disarmed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
or, at the worst, only added to the
fascinated interest with which Octavius watched
his spare and solitary figure upon its streets, and
noted the progress of his efforts to find a footing
for himself in its social economy.</p>

<p>It was taken for granted among us that he
possessed a fine and well-cultivated mind, to
match that thoughtful countenance and that
dignified deportment. This assumption continued
to hold its own in the face of a long series
of failures in the attempt to draw him out.
Almost everybody who was anybody at one
time or another tried to tap Marsena's mental
reservoirs&mdash;and all in vain. Beyond the barest
commonplaces of civil conversation he could
never be tempted. Once, indeed, he had volunteered
to the Rev. Mr. Bunce the statement
that he regarded Washington Allston as in
several respects superior to Copley; but as no
one in Octavius knew who these men were, the
remark did not help us much. It was quoted
frequently, however, as indicating the lofty and
recondite nature of the thoughts with which
Mr. Pulford occupied his intellect. As it became
more apparent, too, that his reserve must
be the outgrowth of some crushing and incurable
heart grief, people grew to defer to it and
to avoid vexing his silent moods with talk.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, when he had been a resident and
neighbor for over two years, though no one
knew him at all well, the whole community regarded
him with kindly and even respectful
emotions, and the girls in particular felt that he
was a distinct acquisition to the place.</p>

<p>I have said that Marsena Pulford was poor.
Hardly anybody in Octavius ever knew to
what pathetic depths his poverty during the
second winter descended. There was a period
of several months, in sober truth, during which
he fed himself upon six or seven cents a day.
As he was too proud to dream of asking credit
at the grocer's and butcher's, and walked about
more primly erect than ever, meantime, in his
frock-coat and gloves, no idea of these privations
got abroad. And at the end of this long
evil winter there came a remarkable spring,
which altered in a violent way the fortunes of
millions of people&mdash;among them Marsena.
We have to do with events somewhat subsequent
to that even, and with the period of Mr.
Pulford's prosperity.</p>


<p class="p2t">The last discredited strips of snow up in the
ravines on the hill-sides were melting away; the
robins had come again, and were bustling busily
across between the willows, already in the leaf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
and the budded elms; men were going about
the village streets without their overcoats, and
boys were telling exciting tales about the suckers
in the creek; our old friend Homer Sage
had returned from his winter's sojourn in the
county poorhouse at Thessaly, and could be seen
daily sitting in the sunshine on the broad stoop
of the Excelsior Hotel. It was April of 1862.</p>

<p>A whole year had gone by since that sudden
and memorable turn in Marsena Pulford's luck.
So far from there being signs now of a possible
adverse change, this new springtide brought
such an increase of good fortune, with its attendant
responsibilities, that Marsena was unable
to bear the halcyon burden alone. He
took in a partner to help him, and then the
firm jointly hired a boy. The partner painted
a signboard to mark this double event, in bold
red letters of independent form upon a yellow
ground:</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p2b">
PULFORD &amp; SHULL.<br />
<span class="smcap">Empire State Portrait Athen&aelig;um and<br />
Studio.</span><br />
War Likenesses at Peace Prices.</p>

<p>Marsena discouraged the idea of hanging this
out on the street; and, as a compromise, it was
finally placed at the end of the operating-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
where for years thereafter it served for the sitters
to stare at when their skulls had been
clasped in the iron head-rest and they had been
adjured to look pleasant. A more modest and
conventional announcement of the new firm's
existence was put outside, and Octavius accepted
it as proof that the liberal arts were at last
established within its borders on a firm and
lucrative basis.</p>

<p>The head of the firm was not much altered
by this great wave of prosperity. He had been
drilled by adversity into such careful ways with
his wardrobe that he did not need to get any
new clothes. Although the villagers, always
kindly, sought now with cordial effusiveness to
make him feel one of themselves, and although
he accepted all their invitations and showed
himself at every public meeting in his capacity
as a representative and even prominent citizen,
yet the heart of his mystery remained unplucked.
Marsena was too busy in these days
to be much upon the streets. When he did
appear he still walked alone, slowly and with
an air of settled gloom. He saluted such passers-by
as he knew in stately silence. If they
stopped him or joined him in his progress, at the
most he would talk sparingly of the weather and
the roads.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>Neither at the fortnightly sociables of the
Ladies' Church Mite Society, given in turn at
the more important members' homes, nor in the
more casual social assemblages of the place, did
Marsena ever unbend. It was not that he held
himself aloof, as some others did, from the
simple amusements of the evening. He never
shrank from bearing his part in "pillow,"
"clap in and clap out," "post-office," or in
whatever other game was to be played, and he
went through the kissing penalties and rewards
involved without apparent aversion. It was
also to be noted, in fairness, that, if any one
smiled at him full in the face, he instantly smiled
in response. But neither smile nor chaste salute
served to lift for even the fleeting instant
that veil of reserve which hung over him.</p>

<p>Those who thought that by having Marsena
Pulford take their pictures they would get on
more intimate terms with him fell into grievous
error. He was more sententious and unapproachable
in his studio, as he called it, than
anywhere else. In the old days, before the
partnership, when he did everything himself,
his manner in the reception-room downstairs,
where he showed samples, gave the prices
of frames, and took orders, had no equal for
formal frigidity&mdash;except his subsequent demeanor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
in the operating-room upstairs. The girls
used to declare that they always emerged from
the gallery with "cold shivers all over them."
This, however, did not deter them from going
again, repeatedly, after the outbreak of the war
had started up the universal notion of being
photographed.</p>

<p>When the new partner came in, in this April
of 1862, Marsena was able to devote himself
exclusively to the technical business of the
camera and the dark-room, on the second floor.
He signalled this change by wearing now every
day an old russet-colored velveteen jacket,
which we had never seen before. This made
him look even more romantically melancholy
and picturesque than ever, and revived something
of the fascinating curiosity as to his hidden
past; but it did nothing toward thawing
the ice-bound shell which somehow came at
every point between him and the good-fellowship
of the community.</p>

<p>The partnership was scarcely a week old
when something happened. The new partner,
standing behind the little show-case in the
reception-room, transacted some preliminary
business with two customers who had come in.
Then, while the sound of their ascending footsteps
was still to be heard on the stairs, he hastily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
left his post and entered the little work-room
at the back of the counter.</p>

<p>"You couldn't guess in a baker's dozen of
tries who's gone upstairs," he said to the boy.
Without waiting for even one effort, he added:
"It's the Parmalee girl, and Dwight Ransom's
with her, and he's got a Lootenant's uniform
on, and they're goin' to be took together!"</p>

<p>"What of it?" asked the unimaginative
boy. He was bending over a crock of nitric
acid, transferring from it one by one to a tub
of water a lot of spoiled glass plates. The
sickening fumes from the jar, and the sting of
the acid on his cracked skin, still further diminished
his interest in contemporary sociology.
"Well, what of it?" he repeated, sulkily.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said the new partner,
in a listless, disappointed way. "It seemed
kind o' curious, that's all. Holdin' her head
up as high in the air as she does, you wouldn't
think she'd so much as look at an ordinary
fellow like Dwight Ransom."</p>

<p>"I suppose this is a free country," remarked
the boy, rising to rest his back.</p>

<p>"Oh, my, yes," returned the other; "if
she's pleased, I'm quite agreeable. And&mdash;I
don't know, too&mdash;I dare say she's gettin' pretty
well along. May be she thinks they ain't any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
too much time to lose, and is making a grab
at what comes handiest. Still, I should 'a'
thought she could 'a' done better than Dwight.
I worked with him for a spell once, you
know."</p>

<p>There seemed to be very few people with
whom Newton Shull had not at one time or
another worked. Apparently there was no
craft or calling which he did not know something
about. The old phrase, "Jack of all
trades," must surely have been coined in
prophecy for him. He had turned up in Octavius
originally, some years before, as the
general manager of a "Whaler's Life on the
Rolling Deep" show, which was specially
adapted for moral exhibitions in connection
with church fairs. Calamity, however, had
long marked this enterprise for its own, and at
our village its career culminated under the
auspices of a sheriff's officer. The boat, the
harpoons, the panorama sheet and rollers, the
whale's jaw, the music-box with its nautical
tunes&mdash;these were sold and dispersed. Newton
Shull remained, and began work as a mender
of clocks. Incidentally, he cut out stencil-plates
for farmers to label their cheese-boxes
with, and painted or gilded ornamental designs
on chair-backs through perforated paper patterns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
For a time he was a maker of children's
sleds. In slack seasons he got jobs to help the
druggist, the tinsmith, the dentist, or the Town
Clerk, and was equally at home with each. He
was one of the founders of the Octavius Philharmonics,
and offered to play any instrument
they liked, though his preference was for what
he called the bull fiddle. He spoke often of
having travelled as a bandsman with a circus.
We boys believed that he was quite capable of
riding a horse bareback as well.</p>

<p>When Marsena Pulford, then, decided that
he must have some help, Newton Shull was
obviously the man. How the arrangement
came to take the form of a partnership was
never explained, save on the conservative village
theory that Marsena must have reasoned
that a partner would be safer with the cash-box
downstairs, while he was taking pictures upstairs,
than a mere hired man. More likely it
grew out of their temperamental affinity. Shull
was also a man of grave and depressed moods
(as, indeed, is the case with all who play the
bass viol), only his melancholy differed from
Marsena's in being of a tirelessly garrulous
character. This was not always an advantage.
When customers came in, in the afternoon, it
was his friendly impulse to engage them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
conversation at such length that frequently the
light would fail altogether before they got upstairs.
He recognized this tendency as a fault,
and manfully combated it&mdash;leaving the reception-room
with abruptness at the earliest possible
moment, and talking to the boy in the
work-room instead.</p>

<p>Mr. Shull was a short, round man, with a
beard which was beginning to show gray under
the lip. His reception-room manners were urbane
and persuasive to a degree, and he particularly
excelled in convincing people that the
portraits of themselves, which Marsena had sent
down to him in the dummy to be dried and
varnished, and which they hated vehemently at
first sight, were really unique and precious works
of art. He had also much success in inducing
country folks to despise the cheap ferrotype
which they had intended to have made, and
to adventure upon the costlier ambrotype, daguerreotype,
or even photograph instead. If
they did not go away with a family album or an
assortment of frames that would come in handy
as well, it was no fault of his.</p>

<p>He made these frames himself, on a bench
which he had fitted up in the work-room. Here
he constructed show-cases, too, cut out mats and
mounts, and did many other things as adjuncts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
to the business, which honest Marsena had never
dreamed of.</p>

<p>"Yes," he went on now, "I carried a chain
for Dwight the best part o' one whole summer,
when he was layin' levels for that Nedahma Valley
Railroad they were figurin' on buildin'.
Guess they ruther let him in over that job&mdash;though
he paid me fair enough. It ain't much
of a business, that surveyin'. You spend about
half your time in findin' out for people the way
they could do things if they only had the money
to do 'em, and the other half in settlin' miserable
farmers' squabbles about the boundaries of
their land. You've got to pay a man day's
wages for totin' round your chain and axe and
stakes&mdash;and, as like as not, you never get even
that money back, let alone any pay for yourself.
I know something about a good many trades,
and I say surveyin' is pretty nigh the poorest
of 'em all."</p>

<p>"George Washington was a surveyor," commented
the boy, stooping down to his task once
more.</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Mr. Shull; "so he was, for
a fact. But then he had influence enough to
get government jobs. I don't say there ain't
money in that. If Dwight, now, could get a
berth on the canal, say, it 'ud be a horse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
another color. They say, there's some places
there that pay as much as $3 a day. That's how
George Washington got his start, and, besides, he
owned his own house and lot to begin with.
But you'll notice that he dropped surveyin' like
a hot potato the minute there was any soldierin'
to do. He knew which side <i>his</i> bread was buttered
on!"</p>

<p>"Well," said the boy, slapping the last plates
sharply into the tub, "that's just what Dwight's
doin' too, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Mr. Shull conceded; "but it ain't
the same thing. You won't find Dwight Ransom
gettin' to be a general, or much of anything
else. He's a nice fellow enough, in his way,
of course; but, somehow, after it's all said and
done, there ain't much to him. I always sort
o' felt, when I was out with him, that by good
rights I ought to be working the level and him
hammerin' in the stakes."</p>

<p>The boy sniffed audibly as he bore away the
acid-jar. Mr. Shull went over to the bench,
and took up a chisel with a meditative air. After
a moment he lifted his head and listened, with
aroused interest written all over his face.</p>

<p>There had been audible from the floor above,
at intervals, the customary noises of the camera
being wheeled about to different points under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the skylight. There came echoing downward
now quite other and most unfamiliar sounds&mdash;the
clatter of animated, even gay, conversation,
punctuated by frank outbursts of laughter. Newton
Shull could hardly believe his ears: but they
certainly did tell him that there were three parties
to that merriment overhead. It was so
strange that he laid aside the chisel, and tiptoed
out into the reception-room, with a notion of
listening at the stair door. Then he even more
hurriedly ran back again. They were coming
downstairs.</p>

<p>It might have been a whole wedding-party
that trooped down the resounding stairway, the
voices rising above the clump of Dwight's artillery
boots and sword on step after step, and
overflowed into the stuffy little reception-room
with a cheerful tumult of babble. The new
partner and the boy looked at each other, then
directed a joint stare of bewilderment toward
the door.</p>

<p>Julia Parmalee had pushed her way behind
the show-case, and stood in the entrance to the
work-room, peering about her with an affectation
of excited curiosity which she may have thought
pretty and playful, but which the boy, at least,
held to be absurd.</p>

<p>She had been talking thirteen to the dozen all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the time. "Oh, I really must see everything!"
she rattled on now. "If I could be trusted
alone in the dark-room with you, Mr. Pulford,
I surely may be allowed to explore all these
minor mysteries. Oh, I see," she added, glancing
round, and incidentally looking quite
through Mr. Shull and the boy, as if they had
been transparent: "here's where the frames and
the washing are done. How interesting!"</p>

<p>What really was interesting was the face of
Marsena Pulford, discernible in the shadow over
her shoulder. No one in Octavius had ever seen
such a beaming smile on his saturnine countenance
before.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>


<p class="center bold in0 p3t p1b"><span class="large">II.</span></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Next</span> to the War, the chief topic of interest
and conversation in Octavius at this
time was easily Miss Julia Parmalee.</p>

<p>To begin with, her family had for two generations
or more been the most important family
in the village. When Lafayette stopped
here to receive an address of welcome, on his
tour through the State in 1825, it was a Parmalee
who read that address, and who also, as
tradition runs, made on his own account several
remarks to the hero in the French language,
all of which were understood. The
elder son of this man has a secure place in history.
He is the Judge Parmalee whose portrait
hangs in the Court House, and whose learned
work on "The Treaties of the Tuscarora Nation,"
handsomely bound in morocco, used to
have a place of honor on the parlor table of
every well-to-do and cultured Octavius home.</p>

<p>This Judge was a banker, too, and did
pretty well for himself in a number of other
commercial paths. He it was who built the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
big Parmalee house, with a stone wall in front
and the great garden and orchard stretching
back to the next street, and the buff-colored
statues on either side of the gravelled walk,
where the Second National Dearborn County
Bank now stands. The Judge had no children,
and, on his widow's death, the property
went to his much younger brother Charles,
who, from having been as a stripling on some
forgotten Governor's staff, bore through life
the title of Colonel in the local speech.</p>

<p>This Colonel Parmalee had a certain distinction,
too, though not of a martial character.
His home was in New York, and for
many years Octavius never laid eyes on him.
He was understood to occupy a respected place
among American men of letters, though exactly
what he wrote did not come to our knowledge.
It was said that he had been at Brook Farm.
I have not been able to find any one who remembers
him there, but the report is of use as
showing the impression of superior intellectual
force which he created, even by hearsay, in his
native village. When he finally came back to
us, to play his part as the head of the Parmalee
house, we saw at intervals, when the sun was
warm and the sidewalks were dry, the lean and
bent figure of an old man, with a very yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
face and a sharp-edged brown wig, moving
feebly about with a thick gray shawl over his
shoulders. His housekeeper was an elderly
maiden cousin, who seemed never to come out
at all, whether the sun was shining or not.</p>

<p>There were three or four of the Colonel's
daughters&mdash;all tall, well-made girls, with strikingly
dark skins, and what we took to be gypsyish
faces. Their appearance certainly bore
out the rumor that their mother had been an
opera-singer&mdash;some said an Italian, others a
lady of Louisiana Creole extraction. No information,
except that she was dead, ever came
to hand about this person. Her daughters,
however, were very much in evidence. They
seemed always to wear white dresses, and they
were always to be seen somewhere, either on
their lawn playing croquet, or in the streets, or
at the windows of their house. The consciousness
of their existence pervaded the whole village
from morning till night. To watch their
goings and comings, and to speculate upon the
identity and business of the friends from strange
parts who were continually arriving to visit
them, grew to be quite the standing occupation
of the idler portion of the community.</p>

<p>Before such of our young people as naturally
took the lead in these matters had had time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
decide how best to utilize for the general good
this influx of beauty, wealth, and ancestral
dignity, the village was startled by an unlooked-for
occurrence. A red carpet was spread one
forenoon from the curb to the doorway of the
Episcopal Church: the old-fashioned Parmalee
carriage turned out, with its driver clasping
white reins in white cotton gloves; we had a
confused glimpse of the dark Parmalee girls
with bouquets in their hands, and dressed
rather more in white than usual: and then astonished
Octavius learned that two of them
had been married, right there under its very
eyes, and had departed with their husbands.
It gave an angry twist to the discovery to find
that the bridegrooms were both strangers,
presumably from New York.</p>

<p>This episode had the figurative effect of
doubling or trebling the height of that stone
wall which stood between the Parmalee place
and the public. Such budding hopes and
projects of intimacy as our villagers may have
entertained toward these polished new-comers
fell nipped and lifeless on the stroke. Shortly
afterward&mdash;that is to say, in the autumn of
1860&mdash;the family went away, and the big house
was shut up. News came in time that the
Colonel was dead: something was said about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
another daughter's marriage; then the war
broke out, and gave us other things to think of.
We forgot all about the Parmalees.</p>

<p>It must have been in the last weeks of 1861
that our vagrant attention was recalled to the
subject by the appearance in the village of an
elderly married couple of servants, who took
up their quarters in the long empty mansion,
and began fitting it once more for habitation.
They set all the chimneys smoking, shovelled
the garden paths clear of snow, laid in
huge supplies of firewood, vegetables, and the
like, and turned the whole place inside out in a
vigorous convulsion of housecleaning. Their
preparations were on such a bold, large scale
that we assumed the property must have passed
to some voluminous collateral branch of the
family, hitherto unknown to us. It came indeed
to be stated among us, with an air of certainty,
that a remote relation named Amos or
Erasmus Parmalee, with eight or more children
and a numerous adult household, was coming
to live there. The legend of this wholly
mythical personage had nearly a fortnight's
vogue, and reached a point of distinctness
where we clearly understood that the coming
stranger was a violent secessionist. This
seemed to open up a troubled and sinister prospect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
before loyal Octavius, and there was a
good deal of plain talk in the barroom of the
Excelsior Hotel as to how this impending
crisis should be met.</p>

<p>It was just after New Year's that our suspense
was ended. The new Parmalees came, and
Octavius noted with a sort of disappointed surprise
that they turned out to be merely a shorn
and trivial remnant of the old Parmalees.
They were in fact only a couple of women&mdash;the
elderly maiden cousin who had presided
before over the Colonel's household, and the
youngest of his daughters, by name Miss Julia.
What was more, word was now passed round
upon authority that these were the sole remaining
members of the family&mdash;that there never
had been any Amos or Erasmus Parmalee at
all.</p>

<p>The discovery cast the more heroic of our
village home-guards into a temporary depression.
It could hardly have been otherwise,
for here were all their fine and strong resolves,
their publicly registered vows about scowling at
the odious Southern sympathizer in the street,
about a "horning" party outside his house at
night, about, perhaps, actually riding him on a
rail&mdash;all brought to nothing. A less earnest
body of men might have suspected in the situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
some elements of the ridiculous. They let
themselves down gently, however, and with a
certain dignified sense of consolation that they
had, at all events, shown unmistakably how
they would have dealt with Amos or Erasmus
Parmalee if there had been such a man, and he
had moved to Octavius and had ventured to
flaunt his rebel sentiments in their outraged
faces.</p>

<p>The village, as a whole, consoled itself on
more tangible grounds. It has been stated
that Miss Julia Parmalee arrived at the family
homestead in early January. Before April had
brought the buds and birds, this young woman
had become President of the St. Mark's Episcopal
Ladies' Aid Society; had organized a local
branch of the Sanitary Commission, and assumed
active control of all its executive and
clerical functions; had committed the principal
people of the community to holding a grand
festival and fair in May for the Field Hospital
and nurse fund; had exhibited in the chief
store window on Main Street a crayon portrait
of her late father, and four water-color
drawings of European scenery, all her own
handiwork; had published over her signature,
in the Thessaly <i>Banner of Liberty</i>, an original
and spirited poem on "Pale Columbia, Shriek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
to Arms!" which no one could read without
patriotic thrills; and had been reported, on
more or less warrant of appearances, to be engaged
to four different young men of the place.
Truly a remarkable young woman!</p>

<p>We were only able in a dim kind of way to
identify her with one of the group of girls in
white dresses whom the village had stared at
and studied from a distance two years before.
There was no mystery about it, however: she
was the youngest of them. They had all looked
so much alike, with their precocious growth,
their olive skins and foreign features, that we
were quite surprised to find now that this one,
regarded by herself, must be a great deal
younger than the others. Perhaps it was only
our rustic shyness which had imputed to the
sisterhood, in that earlier experience, the hauteur
and icy reserve of the rich and exclusive.
We recognized now that if the others were at
all like Julia, we had made an absurd mistake.
It was impossible that anyone could be freer
from arrogance or pretence than Octavius found
her to be. There were some, indeed, who
deemed her emancipation almost too complete.</p>

<p>Some there were, too, who denied that she
was beautiful, or even very good-looking.
There is an old daguerreotype of her as she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
in those days&mdash;or rather as she seemed to be to
the unskilled sunbeams of the sixties&mdash;which
gives these censorious people the lie direct. It
is true that her hair is confined in a net at
the sides and drawn stiffly across her temples
from the parting. The full throat rises sheer
from a flat horizon of striped dress goods, and
is offered no relief whatever by the wide falling-away
collar of coarse lace. And oh! the
strangeness of that frock! The shoulder seams
are to be looked for half-way down the upper
arm, the sleeves swell themselves out into shapeless
bags, the waist front might be the cover of
a chair, of a guitar, of the documents in a corporation
suit&mdash;of anything under the sun rather
than the form of a charming girl. Yet, when
you look at this thin old picture, all the same,
you feel that you understand how it was that
Julia Parmalee took the shine out of all the
other girls in Octavius.</p>

<p>This is the likeness of her which always
seemed to me the best, but Marsena Pulford
made a great many others as well. When you
reflect, indeed, that his output of portraits of
Julia Parmalee was limited in time to the two
months of April and May, their number suggests
that he could hardly have done anything
else the while.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>The first of this large series of pictures was
the one which Marsena liked least. It is true
that Julia looked well in it, standing erect,
with a proud, fine backward tilt to her dark
face and a delicately formed white hand resting
gracefully on the back of a chair. But it happened
that in that chair was seated Lieut.
Dwight Ransom, all spick and span in his new
uniform, with his big gauntlets and sword hilt
brought prominently forward, and with a kind
of fatuous smile on his ruddy face, as if he felt
the presence of those fair fingers on the chair-back,
so teasingly close to his shoulder-strap.</p>

<p>Marsena, in truth, had a strong impulse to
run a destroying thumbnail over the seated figure
on this plate, when the action of the developer
began to reveal its outlines under the
faint yellow light in the dark-room. Of all the
myriad pictures he had washed and drained
and nursed in their wet growth over this tank,
no other had ever stirred up in his breast such
a swift and sharp hostility. He lavished the
deadly cyanide upon that portion of the plate,
too, with grim unction, and noted the results
with a scornful curl on his lip. Like his partner
downstairs, he was wondering what on
earth possessed Miss Parmalee to take up with a
Dwight Ransom. The frown was still on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
brow when he opened the dark-room door.
Then he started back, flushed red, and labored
at an embarrassed smile. Miss Parmalee had
left her place, and stood right in front of him,
so near that he almost ran against her. She
beamed confidently and reassuringly upon him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I want to come in and see you do
all that," she exclaimed, with vivacity. "It
didn't occur to me till after you'd shut the
door, or I'd have asked to come in with you.
I have the greatest curiosity about all these
matters. Oh, it is all done? That's too bad!
But you can make another one&mdash;and that I can
see from the beginning. You know, I'm something
of an artist myself; I've taken lessons for
years&mdash;and this all interests me so much! No,
Lieutenant!"&mdash;she called out from where she
was standing just inside the open door, at
sound of her companion's rising&mdash;"you stay
where you are! There's going to be another,
and it's such trouble to get you posed properly.
Try and keep exactly as you were!"</p>

<p>Thus it happened that she stood very close
to Marsena, as he took out another plate,
flooded it with the sweet-smelling, pungent
collodion, and, with furtive precautions against
the light, lowered it down into the silver bath.
Then he had to shut the door, and she was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
there just beside him. He heard himself pretending
to explain the processes of the films to
her, but his mind was concentrated instead upon
a suggestion of perfume which she had brought
into the reeking little cupboard of a room, and
which mingled languorously with the scents of
ether and creosote in the air. He had known
her by sight for but a couple of months; he
had been introduced to her only a week or so
ago, and that in the most casual way; yet,
strange enough, he could feel his hand trembling
as it perfunctorily moved the plate dipper
up and down in the bath.</p>

<p>A gentle voice fell upon the darkness. "Do
you know, Mr. Pulford," it murmured, "I
felt sure that you were an artist, the very first
time I saw you."</p>

<p>Marsena heaved a long sigh&mdash;a sigh with a
tremulous catch in it, as where sorrow and
sweet solace should meet. "I did start out to
be one," he answered, "but I&mdash;I never
amounted to anything at it. I tried for years,
but I wasn't any good. I had to give it up&mdash;at
last&mdash;and take to this instead."</p>

<p>He lifted the plate with caution, bent to
look obliquely across its surface, and lowered it
again. Then all at once he turned abruptly
and faced her. They were so close to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
other that even in the obscure gloom she caught
the sudden flash of resolution in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I never told any other
living soul," he said, beginning with husky
eagerness, but lapsing now into grave deliberation
of emphasis: "I hate&mdash;this&mdash;like
pizen!"</p>

<p>In the silence which followed, Marsena
mechanically took the plate from the bath, fastened
it in the holder, and stepped to the door.
Then he halted, to prolong for one little instant
this tender spell of magic which had stolen over
him. Here, in the close darkness beside him,
was a sorceress, a siren, who had at a glance
read his sore heart's deepest secret&mdash;at a word
drawn the confession of his maimed and embittered
pride. It was like being shut up with
an angel, who was also a beautiful woman.
Oh, the wonder of it! Broad sunlit landscapes
with Italian skies seemed to be forming themselves
before his mind's eye; his soul sang
songs within him. He very nearly dropped
the plate-holder.</p>

<p>The soft, hovering, half touch of a hand
upon his arm, the cool, restful tones of the
voice in the darkness, came to complete the
witchery.</p>

<p>"I know," she said, "I can sympathize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
with you. I also had my dreams, my aspirations.
But you are wrong to think that you
have failed. Why, this beautiful work of yours,
it all is Art&mdash;pure Art. No person who really
knows could look at it and not see that. No,
Mr. Pulford, you do yourself an injustice; believe
me, you do. Why, you couldn't help
being an artist if you tried; it's born in you.
It shows in everything you do. I saw it from
the very first."</p>

<p>The unmistakable sound of Dwight Ransom's
large artillery boots moving on the floor outside
intervened here, and Marsena hurriedly opened
the door. The Lieutenant glanced with good-natured
raillery at the couple who stood revealed,
blinking in the sharp light.</p>

<p>"One of my legs got asleep," he remarked,
by way of explanation, "so I had to get up
and stamp around. I began to think," he
added, "that you folks were going to set up
housekeeping in there, and not come out any
more at all."</p>

<p>"Don't be vulgar, if you please," said Julia
Parmalee, with a dash of asperity in what purported
to be a bantering tone. "We were
talking of matters quite beyond you&mdash;of Art, if
you desire to know. Mr. Pulford and I discover
that we have a great many opinions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
sentiments about Art in common. It is a feeling
that no one can understand unless they
have it."</p>

<p>"It's the same with getting one's leg asleep,"
said Dwight, "quite the same, I assure you;"
and then came the laughter which Newton Shull
heard downstairs.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>


<p class="center bold in0 p3t p1b"><span class="large">III.</span></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">A day</span> or two later Battery G left Octavius
for the seat of war.</p>

<p>It was not nearly so imposing an event as a
good many others which had stirred the community
during the previous twelve months.
There were already two regiments in the field
recruited from our end of Dearborn County,
and in these at least six or seven companies
were made up wholly of Octavius men. There
had been big crowds, with speeches and music
by the band, to see them off at the old depot.</p>

<p>When they returned, their short term of service
having expired, there were still more fervent
demonstrations, to which zest was added
by the knowledge that they were all to enlist
again, and then we shortly celebrated their second
departure. Some there were who returned
in mute and cold finality&mdash;term of enlistment
and life alike cut short&mdash;and these were borne
through our streets with sombre martial pageantry,
the long wail of the funeral march reaching
out to include the whole valley side in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
note of lamentation. Besides all this, hardly a
week passed that those of us who hung about
the station could not see a train full of troops
on their way to or from the South. A year of
these experiences had left us seasoned veterans
in sightseeing, by no means to be fluttered by
trifles.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the village did not take
Battery G very seriously. To begin with, it
mustered only some dozen men, at least so far
as our local contribution went, and there was
a feeling that we couldn't be expected to go
much out of our way for such a paltry number.
Then, again, an artillery force was somehow
out of joint with our notion of what Octavius
should do to help suppress the Rebellion. Infantrymen
with muskets we could all understand&mdash;could
all be, if necessary. Many of
the farmer boys round about, too, made good
cavalrymen, because they knew both how to ride
and how to groom a horse. But in the name
of all that was mysterious, why artillerymen?
There had never been a cannon within fifty
miles of Octavius; that is, since the Revolution.
Certainly none of our citizens had the
least idea how to fire one off. These enlisted
men of Battery G were no better posted than
the rest; it would take them a three days'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
journey to reach the point where for the first
time they were to see their strange weapon of
warfare. This seemed to us rather foolish.</p>

<p>Moreover, there was a government proclamation
just out, it was said, discontinuing further
enlistments and disbanding the recruiting offices
scattered over the North. This appeared
to imply that the war was about over, or at
least that they had more soldiers already than
they knew what to do with. There were some
who questioned whether, under these circumstances,
it was worth while for Battery G to go
at all.</p>

<p>But go it did, and at the last moment quite
a throng of people found themselves gathered
at the station to say good-by. A good many
of these were the relations and friends of the
dozen ordinary recruits, who would not even
get their uniforms and swords till they reached
Tecumseh. But the larger portion, I should
think, had come on account of Lieutenant Ransom.</p>

<p>Dwight was hail-fellow-well-met with more
people within a radius of twenty miles or so,
probably, than any other man in the district.
He was a good-looking young man, rather
stocky in build and deeply sunburned. Through
the decent months of the year he was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
out of doors, either tramping over the country
with a level over his shoulder, or improving
the days with a shotgun or fish pole. At these
seasons he was generally to be found of an
evening at the barber's shop, where he told
more new stories than any one else. When
winter came his chief work was in his office,
drawing maps and plans. He let his beard
grow then, and spent his leisure for the most
part playing checkers at the Excelsior Hotel.</p>

<p>His habitual free-and-easy dress and amiable
laxity of manners tended to obscure in the village
mind the facts that he came from one of
the best families of the section, that he had
been through college, and that he had some
means of his own. His mother and sisters were
very respectable people indeed, and had one
of the most expensive pews in the Episcopal
Church. It was not observed, however, that
Dwight ever accompanied them thither or that
he devoted much of his time to their society at
home. It began to be remarked, here and
there, that it was getting to be about time for
Dwight Ransom to steady down, if he was ever
going to. Although everybody liked him and
was glad to see him about, an impression was
gradually shaping itself that he never would
amount to much.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>All at once Dwight staggered the public consciousness
by putting on his best clothes one
Sunday and going with his folks to church.
Those who saw him on the way there could not
make it out at all, except on the hypothesis
that there had been a death in the family.
Those who encountered him upon his return
from the sacred edifice, however, found a clue
to the mystery ready made. He was walking
home with Julia Parmalee.</p>

<p>There were others whose passionate desire it
was to walk home with Julia. They had been
enlivening Octavius with public displays of
their rivalry for something like two months
when Dwight appeared on the scene as a competitor.
Easy-going as he was in ordinary
matters, he revealed himself now to be a hustler
in the courts of love. It took him but a
single day to drive the teller of the bank from
the field. The Principal of the Seminary, a
rising young lawyer, and the head bookkeeper
at the freight-house, severally went by the board
within a fortnight.</p>

<p>There remained old Dr. Conger's son Emory,
who was of a tougher fibre and gave Dwight
several added weeks of combat. He enjoyed
the advantage of having nothing whatever to
do. He possessed, moreover, a remarkably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
varied wardrobe and white hands, and loomed
unique among the males of our town in his
ability to play on the piano. With such aids a
young man may go far in a quiet neighborhood,
and for a time Emory Conger certainly seemed
to be holding his own, if not more. His discomfiture,
when it came, was dramatic in its
swift completeness. One forenoon we saw
Dwight on the street in a new and resplendent
officer's uniform, and learned that he had
been commissioned to raise a battery. That
very evening the doctor's son left town, and
the news went round that Lieutenant Ransom
was engaged to Miss Parmalee.</p>

<p>An impression prevailed that Dwight would
not have objected to let the matter rest there.
He had gained his point, and might well regard
the battery and the War itself as things which
had served their purpose and could now be dispensed
with. No one would have blamed him
much for feeling that way about it.</p>

<p>But this was not Julia's view. She adopted
the battery for her own while it was still little
more than a name, and swept it forward with
such a swirling rush of enthusiasm that the men
were all enlisted, the organization settled, and
the date of departure for the front sternly fastened,
before anybody could lay a hand to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
brakes. Her St. Mark's Ladies' Aid Society
presented Dwight with a sword. Her branch
of the Sanitary Commission voted to entertain
the battery with a hot meal in the depot yard
before it took the train. We have seen how
she went and had herself photographed standing
proudly behind the belted and martial
Dwight. After these things it was impossible
for Battery G to back out.</p>

<p>The artillerymen had a bright blue sky and
a warm sunlit noontide for their departure.
Even the most cynical of those who had come
to see them off yielded toward the end to the
genial influence of the weather and the impulse
of good-fellowship, and joined in the handshaking
at the car windows, and in the volley
of cheers which were raised as the train drew
slowly out of the yard.</p>

<p>At this moment the ladies of the Sanitary
Commission had to bestir themselves to save the
remnant of oranges and sandwiches on their
tables from the swooping raid of the youth of
Octavius, and, what with administering cuffs
and shakings, and keeping their garments out
of the way of coffee-cups overturned in the
scramble, had no time to watch Julia Parmalee.</p>

<p>The men gathered in the yard kept her
steadily in view, however, as she stood prominently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
in front of the throng, on the top of a
baggage truck, and waved her handkerchief until
the train had dwindled into nothingness
down the valley. These observers had an eye
also on three young men who had got as near
this truck as possible. Interest in Dwight and
his battery was already giving place to curiosity
as to which of these three&mdash;the bank-teller, the
freight-house clerk, or the rising young lawyer&mdash;would
win the chance of helping Julia down
off her perch.</p>

<p>No one was prepared for what really happened.
Miss Parmalee turned and looked
thoughtfully, one might say abstractedly, about
her. Somehow she seemed not to see any of
the hands which were eagerly uplifted toward
her. Instead, her musing gaze roved lightly
over the predatory scuffle among the tables,
over the ancient depot building, over the assembled
throng of citizens in the background,
then wandered nearer, with the pretty inconsequence
of a butterfly's flight. Of course it
was the farewell to Dwight which had left that
soft, rosy flush in her dark, round cheeks.
The glance that she was sending idly fluttering
here and there did not seem so obviously connected
with the Lieutenant. Of a sudden it
halted and went into a smile.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Pulford! May I trouble you?"
she said in very distinct tones, bending forward
over the edge of the truck, and holding
forth two white and most shapely hands.</p>

<p>Marsena was standing fully six feet away.
Like the others, he had been looking at Miss
Parmalee, but with no hint of expectation in
his eyes. This abrupt summons seemed to surprise
him even more than it did the crowd.
He started, changed color, fixed a wistful, almost
pleading stare upon the sunlit vacancy
just above the head of the enchantress, and confusedly
fumbled with his glove tips, as if to
make bare his hands for this great function.
Then, straightening himself, he slowly moved
toward her like one in a trance.</p>

<p>The rivals edged out of Marsena's way in
dumfounded silence, as if he had been walking
in his sleep, and waking were dangerous. He
came up, made a formal bow, and lifted his
gloved hands in chivalrous pretence of guiding
the graceful little jump which brought Miss
Parmalee to the ground&mdash;all with a pale, motionless
face upon which shone a solemn ecstasy.</p>

<p>It was Marsena's habit, when out of doors,
to carry his right hand in the breast of his
frock-coat. As he made an angle of his elbow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
now, from sheer force of custom, Julia promptly
took the movement as a proffer of physical support,
and availed herself of it. Marsena felt
himself thrilling from top to toe at the touch
of her hand upon his sleeve. If there rose in
his mind an awkward consciousness that this
sort of thing was unusual in Octavius by daylight,
the embarrassment was only momentary.
He held himself proudly erect, and marched
out of the depot yard with Miss Parmalee on
his arm.</p>

<p>As Homer Sage remarked that evening on
the stoop of the Excelsior Hotel, this event
made the departure of Battery G seem by comparison
very small potatoes indeed.</p>

<p>It was impossible for the twain not to realize
that everybody was looking at them, as they
made their way up the shady side of the main
street. But there is another language of the
hands than that taught in deaf-mute schools,
and Julia's hand seemed to tell Marsena's arm
distinctly that she didn't care a bit. As for
him, after that first nervous minute or two, the
experience was all joy&mdash;joy so profound and
overwhelming that he could only ponder it in
dazzled silence. It is true that Julia was talking&mdash;rattling
on with sprightly volubility about
all sorts of things&mdash;but to Marsena her remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
no more invited answers than does so much
enthralling music. When she stopped for a
breath he did not remember what she had been
saying. He only knew how he felt.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd come straight to the gallery
with me," he said; "I'd like first-rate to make
a real picture of you&mdash;by yourself."</p>


<p class="p2t">"Well, I swow!" remarked Mr. Newton
Shull, along in the later afternoon; "I didn't
expect we'd make our salt to-day, with Marsena
away pretty near the whole forenoon, and
all the folks down to the depot, and here it
turns out way the best day we've had yet.
Actually had to send people away!"</p>

<p>"Guess that didn't worry him much," commented
the boy, from where he sat on the
work-bench swinging his legs in idleness.</p>

<p>Mr. Shull nodded his head suggestively.
"No, I dare say not," he said. "I kind o'
begrudge not bein' an operator myself, when
such setters as that come in. She must have
been up there, a full two hours&mdash;them two all by
themselves&mdash;and the countrymen loafin' around
out in the reception-room there, stompin' their
feet and grindin' their teeth, jest tired to death
o' waitin'. It went agin my grain to tell them
last two lots they'd have to come some other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
day; but&mdash;I dunno&mdash;perhaps it's jest as well.
They'll go and tell it around that we've got
more'n we can do&mdash;and that's good for business.
But, all the same, it seemed to me as if
he took considerable more time than was really
needful. He can turn out four farmers in fifteen
minutes, if he puts on a spurt; and here he was
a full two hours, and only five pictures of her to
show for it."</p>

<p>"Six," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, so it was&mdash;countin' the one with her
hair let down," Mr. Shull admitted. "I dunno
whether that one oughtn't to be a little extry.
I thought o' tellin' her that it would be,
on account of so much hair consumin' more
chemicals; but&mdash;I dunno'&mdash;somehow&mdash;she sort
o' looked as if she knew better. Did you ever
notice them eyes o' hern, how they look as if
they could see straight through you, and out on
the other side?"</p>

<p>The boy shook his head. "I don't bother
my head about women," he said. "Got somethin'
better to do."</p>

<p>"Guess that's a pretty good plan too,"
mused Mr. Shull. "Somehow you can't seem
to make 'em out at all. Now, I've been around
a good deal, and yet somehow I don't feel as if
I knew much about women. I'm bound to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
though," he added upon reflection, "they
know considerable about me."</p>

<p>"I suppose the first thing we know now,"
remarked the boy, impatiently changing the
subject, "McClellan'll be in Richmond. They
say it's liable to happen now any day."</p>

<p>Newton Shull was but a lukewarm patriot.
"They needn't hurry on my account," he
said. "It would be kind o' mean to have the
whole thing fizzle out now, jest when the picture
business has begun to amount to something.
Why, we must have took in up'ards of $11 to-day&mdash;frames
and all&mdash;and two years ago we'd
a' been lucky to get in $3. Let's see: there's
two fifties and five thirty-five's, that's $2.75,
and the Dutch boy with the drum, that's $3.40,
counting the mat, and then there's Miss Parmalee&mdash;four
daguerreotypes, and two negatives,
and small frames for each, and two large frames
for crayons she's going to do herself, and cord
and nails&mdash;I suppose she'll think them ought
to be thrown in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! didn't you make her pay in advance?"
asked the boy. "I thought everybody
had to."</p>

<p>"You got to humor some folks," explained
Mr. Shull, with a note of regret in his voice.
"These big bugs with plenty o' money always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
have to be waited on. It ain't right, but it has
to be. Besides, you can always slide on an extra
quarter or so when you send in the bill.
That sort o' evens the thing up. Now, in her
case, for instance, where we'd charge ordinary
folks a dollar for two daguerreotypes, we can
send her in a bill for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Neither Mr. Shull nor the boy had heard
Marsena's descending steps on the staircase, yet
at this moment he entered the little work-room
and walked across it to the bay window, where
the printing was done. There was an unusual
degree of abstraction in his face and mien&mdash;unusual
even for him&mdash;and he drummed absent-mindedly
on the panes as he stood looking out
at the street or the sky, or whatever it was his
listless gaze beheld.</p>

<p>"How much do you think it 'ud be safe
to stick Miss Parmalee apiece for them daguerreotypes?"
asked Newton Shull of his
partner.</p>

<p>Marsena turned and stared for a moment as
if he doubted having heard aright. Then he
made curt answer: "She is not to be charged
anything at all. They were made for her as
presents."</p>

<p>It was the other partner's turn to stare.</p>

<p>"Well, of course&mdash;if you say it's all right,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
he managed to get out, "but I suppose on the
frames we can&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The frames are presents, too," said Marsena,
with decision.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>


<p class="center bold in0 p3t p1b"><span class="large">IV.</span></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">During</span> the fortnight or three weeks following
the departure of Battery G it became
clear to everyone that the War was as
good as over. It had lasted already a whole
year, but now the end was obviously at hand.
The Union Army had the Rebels cooped up
in Yorktown&mdash;the identical place where the
British had been compelled to surrender at the
close of the Revolution&mdash;and it was impossible
that they should get away. The very coincidence
of locality was enough in itself to convince
the most skeptical.</p>

<p>We read that Fitz John Porter had a balloon
fastened by a rope, in which he daily went up
and took a look through his field-glasses at the
Rebels, all miserably huddled together in their
trap, awaiting their doom. Our soldiers wrote
home now that final victory could only be a
matter of a few weeks, or months at the most.
Some of them said they would surely be home
by haying time. Their letters no longer dwelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
upon battles, or the prospect of battles, but
gossiped about the jealousies and quarrels
among our generals, who seemed to dislike
one another much more than they did the
common enemy, and told us long and quite incredible
tales about the mud in Virginia. No
soldier's letter that spring was complete without
a chapter on the mud. There were stories
about mules and their contraband drivers being
bodily sunk out of sight in these weltering seas
of mire, and of new boots being made for the
officers to come up to their armpits, which we
hardly knew whether to believe or not. But
about the fact that peace was practically within
view there could be no doubt.</p>

<p>Under the influence of this mood, Miss Parmalee's
ambitious project for a grand fair and
festival in aid of the Field Hospital and Nurse
Fund naturally languished. If the War was
coming to a close so soon, there could be no
use in going to so much worry and trouble,
to say nothing of the expense.</p>

<p>Miss Julia seemed to take this view of it
herself. She ceased active preparations for the
fair, and printed in the Thessaly <i>Banner of
Liberty</i> a beautiful poem over her own name
entitled "The Dove-like Dawn of White-winged
Peace." She also got herself some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
new and summery dresses, of gay tints and very
fashionable form, and went to be photographed
in each. Her almost daily presence at the
gallery came, indeed, to be a leading topic of
conversation in Octavius. Some said that she
was taking lessons of Marsena&mdash;learning to make
photographs&mdash;but others put a different construction
on the matter and winked as they did
so.</p>

<p>As for Marsena, he moved about the streets
these days with his head among the stars, in a
state of rapt and reverent exaltation. He had
never been what might be called a talker, but
now it was as much as the best of us could do
to get any kind of word from him. He did
not seem to talk to Julia any more than to the
general public, but just luxuriated with a dumb
solemnity of joy in her company, sitting sometimes
for hours beside her on the piazza of the
Parmalee house, or focusing her pretty image
with silent delight on the ground glass of his
best camera day after day, or walking with her,
arm in arm, to the Episcopal church on Sundays.
He had always been a Presbyterian before,
but now he bore himself in the prominent
Parmalee pew at St. Mark's with stately correctness,
rising, kneeling, seating himself, just as
the others did, and helping Miss Julia hold her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Prayer Book with an air of having known the
ritual from childhood.</p>

<p>No doubt a good many people felt that all
this was rough on the absent Dwight Ransom,
and probably some of them talked openly about
it; but interest in this aspect of the case was
swallowed up in the larger attention now given
to Marsena Pulford himself. It began to be
reported that he really came of an extraordinarily
good family in New England, and that an
uncle of his had been in Congress. The legend
that he had means of his own did not take
much root, but it was admitted that he must
now be simply coining money. Some went so
far as to estimate his annual profits as high as
$1,500, which sounded to the average Octavian
like a dream. It was commonly understood
that he had abandoned an earlier intention
to buy a house and lot of his own, and
this clearly seemed to show that he counted
upon going presently to live in the Parmalee
mansion. People speculated with idle curiosity
as to the likelihood of this coming to pass before
the War ended and Battery G returned
home.</p>

<p>Suddenly great and stirring news fell upon the
startled North and set Octavius thrilling with
excitement, along with every other community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
far and near. It was in the first week or so of
May that the surprise came; the Rebels, whom
we had supposed to be securely locked up in
Yorktown, with no alternative save starvation
or surrender, decided not to remain there any
longer, and accordingly marched comfortably
off in the direction of Richmond!</p>

<p>Quick upon the heels of this came tidings that
the Union Army was in pursuit, and that there
had been savage fighting with the Confederate
rear-guard at Williamsburg. The papers said
that the War, so far from ending, must now be
fought all over again. The marvellous story of
the Monitor and Merrimac sent our men folks
into a frenzy of patriotic fervor. Our women
learned with sinking hearts that the new Corps
which included our Dearborn County regiments
was to bear the brunt of the conflict in this
changed order of things. We were all off again
in a hysterical whirl of emotions&mdash;now pride,
now horror, now bitter wrath on top.</p>

<p>In the middle of all this the famous Field
Hospital and Nurse Fund Fair was held. The
project had slumbered the while people thought
peace so near. It sprang up with renewed and
vigorous life the moment the echo of those guns
at Williamsburg reached our ears. And of course
at its head was Julia Parmalee.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>It would take a long time and a powerful ransacking
of memory to catalogue the remarkable
things which this active young woman did toward
making that fair the success it undoubtedly
was. Even more notable were the things which
she coaxed, argued, or shamed other folks into
doing for it. Years afterward there were old
people who would tell you that Octavius had
never been quite the same place since.</p>

<p>For one thing, instead of the Fireman's Hall,
with its dingy aspect and somewhat rowdyish
associations, the fair was held in the Court
House, and we all understood that Miss Julia
had been able to secure this favor on account of
her late uncle, the Judge, when anyone else
would have been refused. It was under her tireless
and ubiquitous supervision that this solemn
old interior now took on a gay and festal face.
Under the inspiration of her glance the members
of the Fire Company and the Alert Baseball Club
vied with each other in borrowing flags and
hanging them from the most inaccessible and
adventurous points. The rivalry between the
local Freemasons and Odd Fellows was utilized
to build temporary booths at the sides and down
the centre&mdash;on a floor laid over the benches by
the Carpenters' Benevolent Association. The
ladies' organizations of the various churches, out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
of devotion to the Union and jealousy of one
another, did all the rest.</p>

<p>At the sides were the stalls for the sale of
useful household articles, and sedate and elderly
matrons found themselves now dragged from the
mild obscurity of homes where they did their
own work, and thrust forward to preside over the
sales in these booths, while thrifty, not to say
penurious, merchants came and stood around
and regarded with amazement the merchandise
which they had been wheedled into contributing
gratis out of their own stores. The suggestion
that they should now buy it back again paralyzed
their faculties, and imparted a distinct restraint
to the festivities at the sides of the big
court-room.</p>

<p>In the centre was a double row of booths for
the sale of articles not so strictly useful, and
here the young people congregated. All the
girls of Octavius seemed to have been gathered
here&mdash;the pretty ones and the plain ones, the
saucy ones and the shy, the maidens who were
"getting along" and the damsels not yet out
of their teens. Stiff, spreading crinolines
brushed juvenile pantalettes, and the dark head
of long, shaving-like ringlets contrasted itself
with the bold waterfall of blonde hair. These
girls did not know one another very well, save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
by little groups formed around the nucleus of a
church association, and very few of them knew
Miss Parmalee at all, except, of course, by sight.
But now, astonishing to relate, she recognized
them by name as old friends, shook hands
warmly right and left, and blithely set them all
to work and at their ease. The idea of selling
things to young men abashed them by its weird
and unmaidenly novelty. She showed them how
it should be done&mdash;bringing forward for the
purpose a sheepishly obstinate drug-store clerk,
and publicly dragooning him into paying eighty
cents for a leather dog-collar, despite his protests
that he had no dog and hated the whole
canine species, and could get such a strap as
that anywhere for fifteen cents&mdash;all amid the
greatest merriment. Her influence was so pervasive,
indeed, that even the nicest girls soon
got into a state of giggling familiarity with comparative
strangers, which gave their elders concern,
and which in some cases it took many
months to straighten out again. But for the
time all was sparkling gaiety. On the second
and final evening, after the oyster supper, the
Philharmonics played and a choir of girls sang
patriotic songs. Then the gas was turned down
and the stereopticon show began.</p>

<p>As the last concerted achievement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
firm of Pulford &amp; Shull, this magic-lantern performance
is still remembered. The idea of
it, of course, was Julia's. She suggested it to
Marsena, and he gladly volunteered to make
any number of positive plates from appropriate
pictures and portraits for the purpose. Then
she pressed Newton Shull into the service to
get a stereopticon on hire, to rig up the platform
and canvas for it, and finally to consent
to quit his post among the Philharmonics when
the music ceased, and to go off up into the
gallery to work the slides. He also, during
Marsena's absence one day, made a slide on
his own account.</p>

<p>Mr. Shull had not taken very kindly to the
idea when Miss Julia first broached it to him.</p>

<p>"No, I don't know as I ever worked a
stereopticon," he said, striving to look with
cold placidity into the winsome and beaming
smile with which she confronted him one day
out in the reception-room. She had never
smiled at him before or pretended even to know
his name. "I guess you'd better hire a man
up from Tecumseh to bring the machine and
run it himself."</p>

<p>"But you can do it so much better, my
dear Mr. Shull!" she urged. "You do everything
so much better! Mr. Pulford often says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
that he never knew such a handy man in all
his life. It seems that there is literally nothing
that you can't do&mdash;except&mdash;perhaps&mdash;refuse a
lady a great personal favor."</p>

<p>Miss Julia put this last so delicately, and
with such a pretty little arch nod of the head
and turn of the eyes, that Newton Shull surrendered
at discretion. He promised everything
on the spot, and he kept his word. In
fact, he more than kept it.</p>

<p>The great evening came, as I have said, and
when the lights were turned down to extinction's
verge those who were nearest the
front could distinguish the vacant chair which
Mr. Shull had been occupying, with his bass
viol leaning against it. They whispered from
one to another that he had gone up in the
gallery to work this new-fangled contrivance.
Then came a flashing broad disk of light on the
screen above the judges' bench, a spreading
sibilant murmur of interest, and the show began.</p>

<p>It was an oddly limited collection of pictures&mdash;mainly
thin and feeble copies of newspaper
engravings, photographic portraits, and ideal
heads from the magazines. Winfield Scott
followed in the wake of Kossuth, and Garibaldi
led the way for John C. Fr&eacute;mont and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Lola Montez. There was applause for the
long, homely, familiar face of Lincoln, and a
derisive snicker for the likeness of Jeff Davis
turned upside down. Then came local heroes
from the district round about&mdash;Gen. Boyce,
Col. McIntyre, and young Adjt. Heron, who
had died so bravely at Ball's Bluff&mdash;mixed with
some landscapes and statuary, and a comic caricature
or two. The rapt assemblage murmured
its recognitions, sighed its deeper emotions,
chuckled over the funny plates&mdash;deeming it all
a most delightful entertainment. From time
to time there were long hitches, marked by a
curious spluttering noise above, and the abortive
flashes of meaningless light on the screen,
and the explanation was passed about in undertones
that Mr. Shull was having difficulties
with the machine.</p>

<p>It was after the longest of these delays that,
all at once, an extremely vivid picture was
jerked suddenly upon the canvas, and, after a
few preliminary twitches, settled in place to
stare us out of countenance. There was no
room for mistake. It was the portrait of Miss
Julia Parmalee standing proudly erect in statuesque
posture, with one hand resting on the
back of a chair, and seated in this chair was
Lieut. Dwight Ransom, smiling amiably.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>There was a moment's deadly hush, while
we gazed at this unlooked-for apparition. It
seemed, upon examination, as if there was a
certain irony in the Lieutenant's grin. Someone
in the darkness emitted an abrupt snort of
amusement, and a general titter arose, hung in
the air for an awkward instant, and then was
drowned by a generous burst of applause.
While the people were still clapping their
hands the picture was withdrawn from the
screen, and we heard Newton Shull call down
from his perch in the gallery:</p>

<p>"You kin turn up the lights now. They
ain't no more to this."</p>

<p>In another minute we were sitting once again
in the broad glare of the gaslight, blinking
confusedly at one another, and with a dazed
consciousness that something rather embarrassing
had happened. The boldest of us began
to steal glances across to where Miss Parmalee
and Marsena sat, just in front of the steps to
the bench.</p>

<p>What Miss Julia felt was beyond guessing,
but there she was, at any rate, bending over
and talking vivaciously, all smiles and collected
nerves, to a lady two seats removed. But Marsena
displayed no such presence of mind. He
sat bolt upright, with an extraordinarily white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
face and a drooping jaw, staring fixedly at the
empty canvas on the wall before him. Such
absolute astonishment was never depicted on
human visage before.</p>

<p>Perhaps from native inability to mind his
own business, perhaps with a kindly view of
saving an anxious situation, the Baptist minister
rose now to his feet, coughed loudly to secure
attention, and began some florid remarks about
the success of the fair, the especial beauty of
the lantern exhibition they had just witnessed,
and the felicitous way in which it had terminated
with a portrait of the beautiful and distinguished
young lady to whose genius and
unwearying efforts they were all so deeply
indebted. In these times of national travail
and distress, he said, there was a peculiar satisfaction
in seeing her portrait accompanied by
that of one of the courageous and noble young
men who had sprung to the defence of their
country. The poet had averred, he continued,
that none but the brave deserved the fair, and
so on, and so on.</p>

<p>Miss Julia listened to it all with her head on
one side and a modestly deprecatory half-smile
on her face. At its finish she rose, turned to
face everybody, made a pert, laughing little
bow, and sat down again, apparently all happiness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
But it was noted that Marsena did not
take his pained and fascinated gaze from that
mocking white screen on the wall straight in
front.</p>


<p class="p2t">They walked in silence that evening to almost
the gate of the Parmalee mansion. Julia
had taken his arm, as usual; but Marsena could
not but feel that the touch was different. It
was in the nature of a relief to him that for
once she did not talk. His heart was too sore,
his brain too bewildered, for the task of even
a one-sided conversation, such as theirs was
wont to be. Then all at once the silence grew
terrible to him&mdash;a weight to be lifted at all
hazards on the instant.</p>

<p>"Shull must have made that last slide himself,"
he blurted out. "I never dreamt of its
being made."</p>

<p>"I thought it came out very well indeed,"
remarked Miss Parmalee, "especially his uniform.
You could quite see the eagles on the
buttons. You must thank Mr. Shull for me."</p>

<p>"I'll speak to him in the morning about
it," said Marsena, with gloomy emphasis. He
sighed, bit his lip, fixed an intent gaze upon
the big dark bulk of the Parmalee house looming
before them, and spoke again. "There's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
something that I want to say to <i>you</i>, though,
that won't keep till morning."</p>

<p>A tiny movement of the hand on his arm
was the only response.</p>

<p>"I see now," Marsena went on, "that I
ain't been making any real headway with you
at all. I thought&mdash;well&mdash;I don't know as I
know just what I did think&mdash;but I guess now
that it was a mistake."</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;there was a distinct flutter of the little
gloved hand. It put a wild thought into Marsena's
head.</p>

<p>"Would you," he began boldly&mdash;"I never
spoke of it before&mdash;but would you&mdash;that is, if
I was to enlist and go to the War&mdash;would
that make any difference?&mdash;you know what I
mean."</p>

<p>She looked up at him with magnetic sweetness
in her dusky, shadowed glance. "How
can any able-bodied young patriot hesitate at
such a time as this?" she made answer, and
pressed his arm.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>


<p class="center bold in0 p3t p1b"><span class="large">V.</span></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> was in this same May, not more than a
week after the momentous episode of the
Field Hospital and Nurse Fund Fair, that Marsena
Pulford went off to the War.</p>

<p>There was no ostentation about his departure.
He had indeed been gone for a day or
two before it became known in Octavius that
his absence from town meant that he had enlisted
down at Tecumseh. We learned that he
had started as a common private, but everybody
made sure that a man of his distinguished
appearance and deportment would speedily get
a commission. Everybody, too, had a theory
of some sort as to the motives for this sudden
and strange behavior of his. These theories
agreed in linking Miss Parmalee with the affair,
but there were hopeless divergencies as to the
exact part she played in it. One party held
that Marsena had been driven to seek death on
the tented field by despair at having been
given the "mitten." Others insisted that he
had not been given the "mitten" at all, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
had gone because her well-known martial
ardor made the sacrifice of her betrothed necessary
to her peace of mind. A minority took
the view which Homer Sage promulgated from
his tilted-back chair on the stoop of the Excelsior
Hotel.</p>

<p>"They ain't nothin' settled betwixt 'em,"
this student of human nature declared. "She
jest dared him to go, and he went. And
if you only give her time, she'll have the
whole male unmarried population of Octavius,
between the ages of sixteen and sixty, down
there wallerin' around in the Virginny swamps,
feedin' the muskeeters and makin' a bid for
glory."</p>

<p>But in a few days there came the terribly exciting
news of Seven Pines and Fair Oaks&mdash;that
first great combat of the revived war in the
East&mdash;and we ceased to bother our heads about
the photographer and his love. The enlisting
fever sprang up again, and our young men began
to make their way by dozens and scores to
the recruiting office at Tecumseh. There were
more farewells, more tears and prayers, not to
mention several funerals of soldiers killed at
Hanover Court House, where that Fifth Corps,
which contained most of our volunteers, had its
first spring smell of blood. And soon thereafter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
burst upon us the awful sustained carnage
of the Seven Days' fighting, which drove out of
our minds even the recollection that Miss Julia
Parmalee herself had volunteered for active service
in the Sanitary Commission, and gone
South to take up her work.</p>

<p>And so July 3d came, bringing with it the
bare tidings of that closing desperate battle of
the week at Malvern Hill, and the movement of
what was left of the Army of the Potomac to
a safe resting place on the James River. We
were beginning to get the details of local interest
by the slow single wire from Thessaly, and
sickening enough they were. The village
streets were filled with silent, horror-stricken
crowds. The whole community seemed to
have but a single face, repeated upon the
mental vision at every step&mdash;a terrible face
with distended, empty eyes, riven brows, and
an open drawn mouth like the old Greek mask
of tragedy.</p>

<p>"I swan! I don't know whether to keep
open to-morrow or not," said Mr. Newton
Shull, for perhaps the twentieth time, as he
wandered once again from the reception-room
into the little workshop behind. "In some
ways it's kind of agin my principles to work
on Independence Day&mdash;but, then again, if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
thought there was likely to be a good many
farmers comin' into town&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They'll be plenty of 'em coming in," said
the boy, over his shoulder, "but they'll steer
clear of here."</p>

<p>"I'm 'fraid so," sighed Mr. Shull. He advanced
a listless step or two and gazed with dejected
apathy at the newspaper map tacked to
the wall, on which the boy was making red and
blue crosses with a colored pencil. "I don't
see much good o' that," he said. "Still, of
course, if it eases your mind any&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's where the fightin' finished," observed
the boy, pointing to a big mark on the
map. "That's Malvern Hill there, and here&mdash;down
where the river takes the big bend&mdash;that's
Harrison's Landing, where the army's movin'
to. See them seven rings? Them are the
battles, one each day, as our men forced their
way down through the Chickahominy swamps,
beginnin' up in the corner with Beaver Dam
Creek. If the map was a little higher it 'ud
show the Pamunkey, where they started from.
My uncle says that the whole mistake was in
ever abandoning the Pamunkey."</p>

<p>"Pa-monkey or Ma-monkey," said Newton
Shull, gloomily, "it wouldn't be no comfort to
me to see it, even on a map. It's jest taken and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
busted me and my business here clean as a
whistle. We ain't paid expenses two days in a
week sence Marseny went. Here I've got now
so't I kin take a plain, everyday sort o' picture
jest about as well as he did&mdash;a little streakid
sometimes, perhaps, and more or less pinholes&mdash;but
still pretty middlin' fair on an average,
and then, darn my buttons if they don't all
stop comin'. It positively don't seem to me as
if there was a single human bein' in Dearborn
County that 'ud have his picture took as a gift.
All they want now is to have enlargements
thrown up from little likenesses of their men
folks that have been killed, and them I don't
know how to do no more'n a babe unborn."</p>

<p>"You knew well enough how to make that
stereopticon slide," remarked the boy with severity.</p>

<p>"Yes," mused Mr. Shull, "that darned
thing&mdash;that made a peck o' trouble, didn't it?
I dunno what on earth possessed me; I kind
o' seemed to git the notion of doin' it into my
head all to once't, and somehow I never dreamt
of its rilin' Marseny so; you couldn't tell
that a man 'ud be so blamed touchy as all that,
could you?&mdash;and I dunno, like as not he'd a'
enlisted any how. But I do wish he'd showed
me how to make them pesky enlargements afore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
he went. If I'd only seen him do one, even
once, I could a' picked the thing up, but I
never did. It's just my luck!"</p>

<p>"Say," said the boy, looking up with a sudden
thought, "do you know what my mother
heard yesterday? It's all over the place that
before Marseny left he went to Squire Schermerhorn's
and made his will, and left everything
he's got to the Parmalee girl, in case he
gits killed. So, if anything happens she'd be
your partner, wouldn't she?"</p>

<p>Newton Shull stared with surprise. "Well,
now, that beats creation," he said, after a little.
"Somehow you know that never occurred
to me, and yet, of course, that 'ud be jest his
style."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," repeated the other, "they say
he's left her every identical thing."</p>

<p>"It's allus that way in this world," reflected
Mr. Shull, sadly. "Them that don't need it
one solitary atom, they're eternally gettin'
every mortal thing left to 'em. Why, that
girl's so rich already she don't know what to
do with her money. If I was her, I bet a
cooky I wouldn't go pikin' off to the battle-field,
doin' nursin' and tyin' on bandages, and
fannin' men while they were gittin' their legs
cut off. No, sirree; I'd let the Sanitary Commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
scuffle along without me, I can tell
you! A hoss and buggy and a fust-class two-dollar-a-day
hotel, and goin' to the theatre jest
when I took the notion&mdash;that'd be good
enough for me."</p>

<p>"I suppose the sign then 'ud be 'Shull &amp;
Parmalee,' wouldn't it?" queried the boy.</p>

<p>"Well, now, I ain't so sure about that,"
said Mr. Shull, thoughtfully. "It might be
that, bein' a woman, her name 'ud come first,
out o' politeness. But then, of course, most
prob'ly she'd want to sell out instid, and then
I'd make the valuation, and she could give me
time. Or she might want to stay in, only on
the quiet, you know&mdash;what they call a silent
partner."</p>

<p>"Nobody 'd ever call her a silent partner,"
observed the boy. "She couldn't keep still if
she tried."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care how much she talked,"
said Mr. Shull, "if she only put enough more
money into the business. I didn't take much
to her, somehow, along at fust, but the more
I've seen of her the more I like the cut of her
jib. She's got 'go' in her, that gal has; she
jest figures out what she wants, and then she
sails in and gits it. It don't matter who the
man is, she jest takes and winds him round her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
little finger. Why, Marseny, here, he wasn't
no more than so much putty in her hands. I
lost all patience with him. You wouldn't
catch me being run by a woman that way."</p>

<p>"So far's I could see," suggested the other,
"she seemed to git pretty much all she
wanted out of you, too. You were dancin'
round, helpin' her at the fair there, like a hen
on a hot griddle."</p>

<p>"It was all on his account," put in the
partner, with emphasis. "Jest to please him;
he seemed so much sot on her bein' humored
in everything. I did feel kind o' foolish about
it at the time&mdash;I never somehow believed much
in doin' work for nothin'&mdash;but maybe it was
all for the best. If what they say about his
makin' a will is true, why it won't do me no
harm to be on good terms with her&mdash;in case&mdash;in
case&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Shull was standing at the window, and
his idle gaze had been vaguely taking in the
general prospect of the street below the while
he spoke. At this moment he discovered that
some one on the opposite sidewalk was making
vehement gestures to attract his attention. He
lifted the sash and put his head out to listen,
but the message came across loud enough for
even the boy inside to hear.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>"You'd better hurry round to the telegraph
office!" this hoarse, anonymous voice cried.
"Malvern Hill list is a-comin' in&mdash;and they
say your pardner's been shot&mdash;shot bad, too!"</p>

<p>Newton Shull drew in his head and stood for
some moments staring blankly at the map on
the wall. "Well, I swan!" he began, with
confused hesitation, "I dunno&mdash;it seems to me&mdash;well,
yes, I guess prob'ly the best thing'll
be for her to put more money into the business&mdash;yes,
that's the plan&mdash;and we kin hire an
operator up from Tecumseh."</p>

<p>But there was no one to pass an opinion on
his project. The boy had snatched his hat,
and could be heard even now dashing his way
furiously down the outer stairs.</p>

<div class="tb">
    * <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span>
</div>

<p>The summer dusk had begun to gather before
Octavius heard all that was to be learned
of the frightful calamity which had befallen
its absent sons. The local roll of death and
disaster from Gaines's Mill earlier in the week
had seemed incredibly awful. This new budget
of horrors from Malvern was far worse.</p>

<p>"Wa'n't the rest of the North doin' anything
at all?" a wild-eyed, disheveled old
farmer cried out in a shaking, half-frenzied
shriek from the press of the crowd round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
telegraph office. "Do they think Dearborn
County's got to suppress this whole damned
rebellion single-handed?"</p>

<p>It seemed to the dazed and horrified throng
as if some such idea must be in the minds of
the rest of the Union. Surely no other little
community&mdash;or big community, either&mdash;could
have had such a hideous blow dealt to it as this
under which Octavius reeled. The list of the
week for the county, including Gaines's Mill,
showed one hundred and eight men dead outright,
and very nearly five hundred more
wounded in battle. It was too shocking for
comprehension.</p>

<p>As evening drew on, men gathered the nerve
to say to one another that there was something
very glorious in the way the two regiments had
been thrust into the front, and had shown
themselves heroically fit for that grim honor.
They tried, too, to extract solace from the news
that the regiments in question had been mentioned
by name in the general despatches as
having distinguished themselves and their county
above all the rest&mdash;but it was an empty and
heart-sickened pretense at best, and when,
about dark, the women folks, who had waited
in vain for them to come home to supper, began
to appear on the skirts of the crowd, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
given up altogether. In after years Octavius
got so that it could cheer those sinister names
of Gaines's Mill and Malvern Hill, and swell
with pride at the memories they evoked. But
that evening no one cheered. It was too terrible.</p>

<p>There was, indeed, a single partial exception
to this rule. The regular service of news
had ceased&mdash;in those days, before the duplex
invention, the single wire had most melancholy
limitations&mdash;but the throng still lingered; and
when, in the failing light, the postmaster was
seen to step up again on the chair by the door
with a bit of paper in his hand, a solemn hush
ran over the assemblage.</p>

<p>"It is a private telegram sent to me personally,"
he explained, in the loud, clear tones of
one who had earned his office by years of stump
speaking; "but it is intended for you all, I
should presume."</p>

<p>The silent crowd pushed nearer, and listened
with strained attention as this despatch was
read:</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="center in0"><span class="smcap">Headquarters Sanitary Commission,<br />
Harrison's Landing, Va.</span>, Wednesday Morning.</p>

<p class="sigleft in0"><span class="smcap">To Postmaster Octavius, N. Y.</span>:<br /></p>

<p>No words can describe magnificent record soldiers of
Dearborn County, especially Starbuck, made past week.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
I bless fate which identified my poor services with such
superb heroism. After second sleepless night, Col.
Starbuck now reposing peacefully; doctor says crisis
past; he surely recover, though process be slow. You
will learn with pride he been brevetted Brigadier, fact
which it was my privilege to announce to him last evening.
He feebly thanked me, murmuring, "Tell
them at home."</p>

<p class="sigright">"<span class="smcap">Julia Parmalee.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In the silence which ensued the postmaster
held the paper up and scanned it narrowly by
the waning light. "There is something else,"
he said&mdash;"Oh, yes, I see; 'Franked despatch
Sanitary Commission.' That's all."</p>

<p>Another figure was seen suddenly clambering
upon the chair, with an arm around the postmaster
for support. It was the teller of the
bank. He waved his free arm excitedly, as he
faced the crowd, and cried:</p>

<p>"Our women are as brave as our men!
Three cheers for Miss Julia Parmalee! Hip-hip!"</p>

<p>The loyal teller's first "Hurrah!" fell upon
the air quite by itself. Perhaps a dozen voices
helped him half-heartedly with the second.
The third died off again miserably, and he
stepped down off the chair amid a general consciousness
of failure.</p>

<p>"Who the hell is Starbuck?" was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
heard in whispered interrogatory passed along
through the throng. Hardly anybody could
answer. Boyce we knew, and McIntyre, and
many others, but Starbuck was a mystery.
Then it was explained that it must be the son
of old Alanson Starbuck, of Juno Mills, who
had gone away to Philadelphia seven or eight
years before. He had not enlisted with any
Dearborn County regiment, but held a staff
appointment of some kind, presumably in a
Pennsylvania command. We were quite unable
to work up any emotion over him.</p>

<p>In fact, the more we thought it over, the
more we were disposed to resent this planting
of Starbuck upon us, in the very van of Dearborn
County's heroes. His father was a rich
old curmudgeon, whom no one liked. The son
was nothing to us whatever.</p>

<p>As at last, in the deepening twilight, the
people reluctantly began moving toward home,
such conversation as they had the heart for
seemed to be exclusively centred upon Miss
Parmalee, and this queer despatch of hers.
Slow-paced, strolling groups wended their way
along the main street, and then up this side
thoroughfare and that, passing in every block
some dark and close-shuttered house of mourning,
and instinctively sinking still lower their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
muffled tones as they passed, and carrying in
their breasts, heaven only knows what torturing
loads of anguish and stricken despair&mdash;but finding
a certain relief in dwelling, instead, upon
this lighter topic.</p>

<p>One of these groups&mdash;an elderly lady in
black attire and two younger women of sober
mien&mdash;walked apart from the others and exchanged
no words at all until, turning a corner,
their way led them past the Parmalee house.
The looming bulk of the old mansion and the
fragrant spaciousness of the garden about it
seemed to attract the attention of Mrs. Ransom
and her daughters. They halted as by a common
impulse, and fastened a hostile gaze upon
the shadowy outlines of the house and its surrounding
foliage.</p>

<p>"If Dwight dies of his wound," the mother
said, in a voice all chilled to calmness, "his
murderess will live in there."</p>

<p>"I always hated her!" said one of the
daughters, with a shudder.</p>

<p>"But he isn't going to die, mamma," put
in the other. "You mustn't think of such a
thing! You know how healthy he always has
been, and this is only his shoulder. For my
part, we may think ourselves very fortunate.
Remember how many have been killed or mortally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
wounded. It seems as if half the people
we know are in mourning. We get off very
lightly with Dwight only wounded. Did you
happen to hear the details about Mr. Pulford?&mdash;you
know, the photographer&mdash;someone was
saying that he was mortally wounded."</p>

<p>"She sent him to his death, then, too," said
the elder Miss Ransom, raising her clenched
hand against the black shadow of the house.</p>

<p>"I don't care about that man," broke in the
mother, icily. "Nobody knows anything of
him, or where he came from. People ran after
him because he was good-looking, but he never
seemed to me to know enough to come in
when it rained. If she made a fool of him, it
was his own lookout. But Dwight&mdash;my
Dwight&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The mother's mannered voice broke into a
gasp, and she bent her head helplessly. The
daughters went to her side, and the group
passed on into the darkness.</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p3t p1b"><span class="large">VI.</span></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> was a dark, soft, summer night in Virginia,
that of the 1st of July. After the tropical
heat of the day, the air was being mercifully
cooled, here on the hilltop, by a gentle breeze,
laden with just a moist suggestion of the mist
rising from the river flats and marshes down below.
It was not Mother Nature's fault that
this zephyr stirring along the parched brow of
the hill did not bear with it, too, the scents of
fruits and flowers, of new-mown hay and the
yellow grain in shock, and minister soothingly
to rest and pleasant dreams.</p>

<p>Instead, this breeze, moving mildly in the
darkness, was one vile, embodied stench of sulphur
and blood, and pestilential abominations.
Go where you would, there was no escaping
this insufferable burden of foul smells. If they
were a horror on the hilltop, they were worse
below.</p>

<p>It was one of the occasions on which Man
had expended all his powers to prove his superiority
to Nature. The elements in their wildest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
and most savage mood could never have
wrought such butchery as this. The vine-wrapped
fences, stretching down from the plateau
toward the meadow lands below, were buttressed
by piles of dead men, some in butternut,
some in blue. Clumps of stiffened bodies
curled supine at the base of every stump on the
fringe of the woodland to the right and among
the tumbled sheaves of grain to the left. Out
in the open, the broad, sloping hillside and the
valley bottom lay literally hidden under ridge
upon ridge of smashed and riddled human
forms, and the heaped debris of human battle.
The clouds hung thick and close above, as if
to keep the stars from beholding this repellent
sample of earth's titanic beast, Man, at his
worst. An Egyptian blackness was over it all.</p>

<p>At intervals a lightning flash from the crest
of the outermost knoll tore this evil pall of
darkness asunder, and then, with a roar and a
scream, a spluttering line of vivid flame would
arch its sinister way across the sky. A thousand
little dots of light moved and zigzagged
ceaselessly on the wide expanse of obscurity
underneath this crest, and when the bursts
of wrathful fireworks came from overhead it
could be seen that these were lanterns being
borne about in and out among the winrows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
maimed and slain. Above all, through all,
without even an instant's lull, there arose a terrible
babel of chorused groans and prayers and
howls and curses. This noise could be heard
for miles&mdash;almost as far as the boom of the howitzers
above could carry&mdash;and at a distance
sounded like the moaning of a storm through a
great pine-forest. Near at hand, it sounded
like nothing else this side of hell.</p>

<p>An hour or so after nightfall the battery on
the crest of the knoll stopped firing. The wails
and shrieks from the slope below went on all
through the night, and the lanterns of the search
parties burned till the morning sunlight put
them out.</p>

<p>Up on the top of the hill&mdash;a broad expanse
of rolling plateaus&mdash;the scene wore a different
aspect. At widely separated points bonfires
and glittering lights showed where some general
of the victorious army held his headquarters
in a farm-house; and unless one pried too curiously
about these parts, there were few enough
evidences on the summit of the day's barbaric
doings.</p>

<p>The chief of these houses&mdash;a stately and ancient
structure, built in colonial days of brick
proudly brought from Europe&mdash;had begun the
forenoon of the battle as the headquarters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
the Fifth Corps. Then the General and his
staff had reduced their needs to a couple of
rooms, to leave space for wounded men. Then
they had moved out altogether, to let the whole
house be used as a hospital. Then as the backwash
of calamity from the line of conflict
swelled in size and volume, the stables and
barns had been turned over to the medical staff.
Later, as the savage evening fight went on, tons
of new hay had been brought out and strewn in
sheltered places under the open sky to serve as
beds for the sufferers. Before night fell, even
these impromptu hospitals were overtaxed, and
rows of stricken soldiers lay on the bare ground.</p>

<p>The day of intelligent and efficient hospital
service had not yet dawned for our army. The
breakdown of what service we had had, under
the frightful stress of the battles culminating in
this blood-soaked Malvern Hill, is a matter of
history, and it can be viewed the more calmly
now as the collapse of itself brought about an
improved condition of affairs. But at the time
it was a woful thing, with a lax and conflicting
organization, insufficient material, a ridiculous
lack of nurses, a mere handful of really
competent surgeons and, most of all, a great
crowd of volunteer medical students and ignorant
practitioners, who flocked southward for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the mere excitement and practice of sawing,
cutting, slashing right and left. So it was that
army surgery lent new terrors to death on the
battle-field in the year 1862.</p>

<p>The sky overhead was just beginning to show
the ashen touch of twilight, when two men lying
stretched on the hay in a corner of the
smaller barnyard chanced to turn on their
hard couch and to recognize each other. It
was a slow and almost scowling recognition,
and at first bore no fruit of words.</p>

<p>One was in the dress of a lieutenant of artillery,
muddy and begrimed with smoke, and
having its right shoulder torn or cut open from
collar to elbow. The man himself had now
such a waving, tangled growth of chestnut
beard and so grimly blackened a face, that it
would have been hard to place him as our easy-going,
smiling Dwight Ransom.</p>

<p>The new movement had not brought ease,
and now, after a few grunts of pain and impatience,
he got himself laboriously up in a sitting
posture, dragged a knapsack within reach up to
support his back, and looked at his companion
again.</p>

<p>"I heard that you were down here somewhere,"
he remarked, at last. "My sister
wrote me."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>Marsena Pulford stared up at him, made a
little nodding motion of the head, and turned
his glance again into the sky straight above.
He also was a spectacle of dry mud and dust,
and was bearded to the eyes.</p>

<p>"Where are you hit?" asked Dwight, after
a pause.</p>

<p>For answer, Marsena slowly, and with an effort,
put a hand to his breast&mdash;to the left, below
the heart. "Here, somewhere," he said, in a
low, dry-lipped murmur. He did not look at
Dwight again, but presently asked, "Could
you fix me&mdash;settin' up&mdash;too?"</p>

<p>"I guess so," responded Dwight. With
the help of his unhurt arm he clambered to his
feet and began moving dizzily about among the
row of wounded men to his left. These groaned
or snarled at him as he passed over them, but
to this he paid no attention whatever. He returned
from the end of the line, bringing two
knapsacks and the battered frame of a drum, in
which some one had been trying to carry water,
and with some difficulty arranged these in a satisfactory
heap. Then he knelt, pushed his arm
under Marsena's shoulders, and lifted him up and
backward to the support. Both men grimaced
and winced under the smart of the effort, and for
some minutes sat in silence, with closed eyes.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<p>When they opened them finally it was with a
sudden start at the sound of a woman's voice.
Their ears had for long hours been inured to a
ceaseless din of other noises&mdash;an ear-splitting
confusion of cannon and musketry roar from
the field less than an eighth of a mile away, of
yelping shells overhead, and of screams and
hoarse shouts all about them. Yet their senses
caught this strange note of a woman's voice as
if it had fallen upon the hush of midnight.</p>

<p>They looked up, and beheld Miss Julia Parmalee!</p>

<p>Upon such a background of heated squalor,
dirt, and murderous disorder, it did not seem
surprising to them that this lady should present
a picture of cool, fresh neatness. She wore a
snow-white nurse's cap, and broad, spotless
bands of white linen were crossed over the
shoulders of her pale dove-colored dress. Her
dark face, dusky pink at the cheeks, glowed
with a proud excitement. Her big brown eyes
swept along the row of recumbent figures at
her feet with the glance of a born conqueror.</p>

<p>"This is not a fit place for him," she said.
"It is absurd to bring a gentleman&mdash;an officer
of the headquarters staff&mdash;out to such a place
as this!"</p>

<p>Then the two volunteers from Octavius saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
that behind her were four men, bearing a laden
stretcher, and that at her side was a regimental
hospital steward, who also looked speculatively
along the rows of sufferers.</p>

<p>"It's the best thing we can do, anyway,"
he replied, not over politely; "and for that
matter, there's hardly room here."</p>

<p>"Oh, there'd be no trouble about that,"
retorted Miss Julia, calmly. "We could move
any of these people here. The General told
me I was always to do just what I thought
best. I am sure that if I could see him now
he would insist at once that Colonel Starbuck
should have a bed to himself, inside the
house."</p>

<p>"I'll bet he wouldn't!" said the hospital
steward, with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't realize," put in Miss
Julia, coldly, "that Colonel Starbuck is a staff
officer&mdash;and a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"I don't care if he was on all the staffs
there are," said the hospital steward, "he's
got to take his chance with the rest. And it
don't matter about his being a friend, either;
we ain't playing favorites much just now. I
don't see no room here, Miss. You'll have to
take him out in the open lot there."</p>

<p>"Oh, never!" protested Miss Julia, vehemently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
"It's disgraceful! Why, the place is
under fire there. I saw them running away
from a shell there only a minute ago. No, if
we can't do anything better, we'll have one of
these men moved."</p>

<p>"Well, do something pretty quick!" growled
one of the men supporting the stretcher.</p>

<p>Miss Parmalee had looked two or three times
in an absent-minded way at the two men on
the ground nearest her&mdash;obviously without recognizing
either of them. There was a definite
purpose in the glance she now bent upon
Dwight Ransom&mdash;a glance framed in the resourceful
smile he remembered so well.</p>

<p>"You seem to be able to sit up, my man,"
she said, ingratiatingly, to him; "would you
be so very kind as to let me have that place
for Colonel Starbuck, here&mdash;he is on the headquarters
staff&mdash;and I am sure we should be so
much obliged. You will easily get a nice place
somewhere else for yourself. Oh, thank you so
much! It is so good of you!"</p>

<p>Suppressing a groan at the pain the movement
involved, and without a word, Dwight
lifted himself slowly to his feet, and stepped
aside, waving a hand toward the hay and
knapsack in token of their surrender.</p>

<p>Then Miss Julia helped lift from the litter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
object of her anxiety. Colonel Starbuck was
of a slender, genteel figure, and had the top of
his head swathed heavily in bandages. He wore
long, curly, brown side-whiskers, and his chin
had been shaved that very morning. This was
enough in itself to indicate that he belonged to
the headquarters staff, but the fact was proclaimed
afresh by everything else about him&mdash;his
speckless uniform, his spick-and-span gauntlets,
his carefully polished boots, the glittering
newness of his shoulder-straps, sword scabbard,
buttons, and spurs. It was clear that, whatever
else had happened, his line of communication
with the headquarters baggage train
had never been interrupted.</p>

<p>"It is so kind of you!" Miss Parmalee murmured
again, when the staff officer had been
helped off the stretcher, and in a dazed and
languid way had settled himself down into the
place vacated for him. "Would you"&mdash;she
whispered, looking up now, and noting that
the hospital steward and the litter-men had
gone away&mdash;"would you mind stepping over
to the house, or to one of the tents beyond&mdash;you'll
find him somewhere&mdash;and asking Dr.
Willoughby to come at once? Tell him it is
for Colonel Starbuck of the headquarters staff,
and you'd better mention my name&mdash;Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Parmalee, of the Sanitary Commission. You
won't forget the name&mdash;Parmalee?"</p>

<p>"I don't fancy I shall forget it," said Dwight,
gravely. "I've got a better memory than
some."</p>

<p>Miss Julia caught the tone of voice on the
instant, and looked upward again from where
she knelt beside the Colonel, with a swift smile.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Mr. Ransom, I do believe!"
she exclaimed. "I should never have known
you with your beard. It's so good of you to
take this trouble&mdash;you always were so obliging!
Any one will tell you where Dr. Willoughby
is. He's the surgeon of the Eighteenth,
you know. I'm sure he'll come at
once&mdash;to please me&mdash;and time is so precious,
you know!"</p>

<p>Without further words, Dwight moved off
slowly and unsteadily toward the house.</p>

<p>Miss Parmalee, seating herself so that some
of her mouse-tinted draperies almost touched
the face of Dwight's companion, unhooked a
fan from her girdle and began softly fanning
Colonel Star buck. "The doctor won't be
long," she said, in low, cooing tones, after a
little; "do you feel easier now?"</p>

<p>"I am rather dizzy still, and a little faint,"
replied the Colonel, languorously. "That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
fanning is so delicious though, that I'm really
very happy. At least I would be if I weren't
nervous about you. You have been through
such tremendous exertions all day&mdash;out in the
sun, amid all these horrid sights and this infernal
roar&mdash;without a parasol, too. Are you
quite sure it has not been too much for you?"</p>

<p>"You are always so thoughtful of others,
dear Colonel Starbuck," murmured Miss Julia,
reducing the fanning to a gentle, measured
movement, and fixing her lustrous eyes pensively
upon the clouds above the horizon.
"You never think of yourself!"</p>

<p>"Only to think how happy my fate is, to be
rescued and nursed by an angel," sighed the
Colonel.</p>

<p>A smile of gentle deprecation played upon
Miss Julia's red lips, and imparted to her eyes
the expression they would wear if they had
been gazing upon a tenderly entrancing vision
in the sky. Then, all at once; she gave a little
start of aroused attention, looked puzzled, and
after a moment's pause bent her head over
close to the Colonel's.</p>

<p>"The man behind me has taken tight hold
of my dress," she whispered, hurriedly. "I
don't want to turn around, but can you see him?
He isn't having a fit or anything, is he?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Starbuck lifted himself a trifle, and
looked across. "No," he whispered in return,
"he appears to be asleep. Probably he
is dreaming. He is a corporal&mdash;some infantry
regiment. They do manage to get so&mdash;what
shall I say&mdash;so unwashed! Shall I move his
hand for you?"</p>

<p>Miss Julia shook her head, with an arch
little half smile.</p>

<p>"No, poor man," she murmured. "It gives
me almost a sense of the romantic. Perhaps
he is dreaming of home&mdash;of some one dear to
him. Corporals do have their romances, you
know, as well as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As well as colonels," the staff officer playfully
finished the sentence for her. "Well,
I congratulate him, if his is a thousandth part
as joyful as mine."</p>

<p>"Oh, then, you have one!" pursued Miss
Parmalee, allowing her eyes to sparkle for an
instant before they were coyly raised again to
the clouds. Darkness was gathering there
rapidly.</p>

<p>"Why pretend that you don't understand?"
pleaded Colonel Starbuck&mdash;and there seemed to
be no answer forthcoming. The fan moved
even more sedately now, with a tender flutter
at the end of each downward sweep.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>Presently the preoccupation of the couple&mdash;one
might not call it silence in such an unbroken
uproar as rose around them and
smashed through the air above&mdash;was interrupted
by the appearance of a young, sharp-faced
man, who marched straight across the
yard toward them and, halting, spoke hurriedly.</p>

<p>"I was asked specially to come here for a
moment," he said, "but it can only be a
minute. We're just over our heads in work.
What is it?"</p>

<p>Miss Parmalee looked at the young man with
a favorless eye. He was unshaven, dishevelled,
brusque of manner and speech. He was bareheaded,
and his unimportant figure was almost
hidden beneath a huge, revoltingly stained
apron.</p>

<p>"I asked for my friend, Dr. Willoughby,"
she said. "But if he could not come, I must insist
upon immediate attention for Colonel Starbuck
here&mdash;an officer of the headquarter staff."</p>

<p>While she spoke the young surgeon had
thrown himself on one knee, adroitly though
roughly lifted the Colonel's bandages, run an
inquiring finger over his skull, and plumped
the linen back again. He sprang to his feet
with an impatient grunt. "Paltry scalp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
wound," he snorted. Then, turning on his
heel, he almost knocked against Dwight Ransom,
who had come slowly up behind him.</p>

<p>"You had no business to drag me off for
foolishness of this sort," he said, in vexed
tones. "Here are thousands of men waiting
their turn who really need help, and I've been
working twenty hours a day for a week, and
couldn't keep up with the work if every day
had two hundred hours. It's ridiculous!"</p>

<p>Dwight shrugged his unhurt shoulder. "I
didn't ask you for myself," he replied. "I'm
quite willing to wait my turn&mdash;but the lady
here&mdash;she asked me to bring help&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It can't be that this gentleman understands,"
put in Miss Julia, "that his assistance
was desired for an officer of the headquarters
staff."</p>

<p>"Madame," said the young surgeon, "with
your permission, damn the headquarters staff!"
and, turning abruptly, he strode off.</p>

<p>"I will go and see the General myself," exclaimed
Miss Parmalee, flushing with wrath.
"I will see whether he will permit the Sanitary
Commission to be affronted in this outrageous&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped short. Her indignant effort to
rise to her feet had been checked by a hand on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
firmly the ground, which held in its grasp a
fold of her skirt. She turned, pulled the cloth
from the clutch of the tightened fingers, looked
at the hand as it sprawled limply on the grass,
and gave a little, shuddering, half-hysterical
laugh. "Mercy me!" was what she said.</p>

<p>"You know who it is, don't you?" asked
Dwight Ransom.</p>

<p>The meaning in his voice struck Miss Julia,
and she bent a careful scrutiny through the
dusk upon the face of the man stretched out
beside her. His head had slipped sidewise on
the knapsack, and his bearded chin was unnaturally
sunk into his collar. Through the grime
on his face could be discerned an unearthly
pallor. His wide-open eyes seemed staring
fixedly, reproachfully, at the hand which had
lost its hold upon Miss Julia's dress.</p>

<p>"It does seem as if I'd seen the face before
somewhere," she remarked, "but I don't appear
to place it. It is getting so dark, too.
No, I can't imagine. Who is it?"</p>

<p>She had risen to her feet and was peering
down at the dead man, her pretty brows knitted
in perplexity.</p>

<p>"He recognized you!" said Dwight, with
significant gravity. "It's Marsena Pulford."</p>

<p>"Oh, poor man!" exclaimed Julia. "If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95&ndash;96</a></span>
he'd only spoken to me I would gladly have
fanned him, too. But I was so anxious about
the Colonel here that I never took a fair look
at him. I dare say I shouldn't have recognized
him, even then. Beards do change one so,
don't they!"</p>

<p>Then she turned to Colonel Starbuck and
made answer to the inquiry of his lifted eyebrows.</p>

<p>"The unfortunate man," she explained,
"was our village photographer. I sat to him
for my picture several times. I think I have
one of them over at the Commission tent now."</p>

<p>"I'll go this minute and seize it!" the gallant
Colonel vowed, getting to his feet.</p>

<p>"Take care! We unprotected females have
a man trap there!" Julia warned him; but fear
did not deter the staff officer from taking her
arm and leaning on it as they walked away in
the twilight.</p>

<p>Then the night fell, and Dwight buried
Marsena.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Although</span> we had been one man short
all day, and there was a plain threat of
rain in the hot air, everybody left the hay-field
long before sundown. It was too much to ask
of human nature to stay off up in the remote
meadows, when such remarkable things were
happening down around the house.</p>

<p>Marcellus Jones and I were in the pasture,
watching the dog get the cows together for the
homeward march. He did it so well and,
withal, so willingly, that there was no call for
us to trouble ourselves in keeping up with him.
We waited instead at the open bars until the
hay-wagon had passed through, rocking so
heavily in the ancient pitch-hole, as it did so,
that the driver was nearly thrown off his perch
on the top of the high load. Then we put up
the bars, and fell in close behind the haymakers.
A rich cloud of dust, far ahead on the
road, suggested that the dog was doing his work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
even too willingly, but for the once we feared
no rebuke. Almost anything might be condoned
that day.</p>

<p>Five grown-up men walked abreast down the
highway, in the shadow of the towering wagon
mow, clad much alike in battered straw hats,
gray woollen shirts open at the neck, and rough
old trousers bulging over the swollen, creased
ankles of thick boots. One had a scythe on
his arm; two others bore forks over their
shoulders. By request, Hi Tuckerman allowed
me to carry his sickle.</p>

<p>Although my present visit to the farm had
been of only a few days' duration&mdash;and those
days of strenuous activity darkened by a terrible
grief&mdash;I had come to be very friendly with
Mr. Tuckerman. He took a good deal more
notice of me than the others did; and, when
chance and leisure afforded, addressed the bulk
of his remarks to me. This favoritism, though
it fascinated me, was not without its embarrassing
side. Hi Tuckerman had taken part in
the battle of Gaines's Mill two years before,
and had been shot straight through the tongue.
One could still see the deep scar on each of his
cheeks, a sunken and hairless pit in among his
sandy beard. His heroism in the war and
his good qualities as a citizen had earned for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
him the esteem of his neighbors, and they saw
to it that he never wanted for work. But
their present respect for him stopped short of
the pretence that they enjoyed hearing him
talk. Whenever he attempted conversation,
people moved away, or began boisterous dialogues
with one another to drown him out.
Being a sensitive man, he had come to prefer
silence to these rebuffs among those he knew.
But he still had a try at the occasional polite
stranger&mdash;and I suppose it was in this capacity
that I won his heart. Though I never of my
own initiative understood a word he said, Marcellus
sometimes interpreted a sentence or so
for me, and I listened to all the rest with a
fraudulently wise face. To give only a solitary
illustration of the tax thus levied on our friendship,
I may mention that when Hi Tuckerman
said "<i>Aah!</i>-ah-<i>aah!</i>-uh," he meant "Rappahannock,"
and he did this rather better than
a good many other words.</p>

<p>"Rappahannock," alas! was a word we
heard often enough in those days, along with
Chickahominy and Rapidan, and that odd
Chattahoochee, the sound of which raised always
in my boyish mind the notion that the
geography-makers must have achieved it in
their baby-talk period. These strange Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
river names and many more were as familiar
to the ears of these four other untravelled
Dearborn County farmers as the noise of
their own shallow Nedahma rattling over its
pebbles in the valley yonder. Only when
their slow fancy fitted substance to these names
they saw in mind's eye dark, sinister, swampy
currents, deep and silent, and discolored with
human blood.</p>

<p>Two of these men who strode along behind
the wagon were young half-uncles of mine,
Myron and Warren Turnbull, stout, thick-shouldered,
honest fellows not much out of
their teens, who worked hard, said little, and
were always lumped together in speech, by their
family, the hired help, and the neighbors, as
"the boys." They asserted themselves so
rarely, and took everything as it came with
such docility, that I myself, being in my eleventh
year, thought of them as very young indeed.
Next them walked a man, hired just
for the haying, named Philleo, and then, scuffling
along over the uneven humps and hollows
on the outer edge of the road, came Si Hummaston,
with the empty ginger-beer pail knocking
against his knees.</p>

<p>As Tuckerman's "Hi" stood for Hiram, so
I assume the other's "Si" meant Silas, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
possibly Cyrus. I dare say no one, not even
his mother, had ever called him by his full
name. I know that my companion, Marcellus
Jones, who wouldn't be thirteen until after
Thanksgiving, habitually addressed him as Si,
and almost daily I resolved that I would do so
myself. He was a man of more than fifty, I
should think, tall, lean, and what Marcellus
called "bible-backed." He had a short iron-gray
beard and long hair. Whenever there
was any very hard or steady work going, he
generally gave out and went to sit in the shade,
holding a hand flat over his heart, and shaking
his head dolefully. This kept a good many
from hiring him, and even in haying-time,
when everybody on two legs is of some use, I
fancy he would often have been left out if it
hadn't been for my grandparents. They respected
him on account of his piety and his
moral character, and always had him down
when extra work began. He was said to be
the only hired man in the township who could
not be goaded in some way into swearing.
He looked at one slowly, with the mild expression
of a heifer calf.</p>

<p>We had come to the crown of the hill, and
the wagon started down the steeper incline,
with a great groaning of the brake. The men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
by some tacit understanding, halted and overlooked
the scene.</p>

<p>The big old stone farm-house&mdash;part of which
is said to date almost to the Revolutionary
times&mdash;was just below us, so near, indeed, that
Marcellus said he had once skipped a scaling-stone
from where we stood to its roof. The
dense, big-leafed foliage of a sap-bush, sheltered
in the basin which dipped from our feet, pretty
well hid this roof now from view. Farther on,
heavy patches of a paler, brighter green marked
the orchard, and framed one side of a cluster of
barns and stables, at the end of which three or
four belated cows were loitering by the trough.
It was so still that we could hear the clatter of
the stanchions as the rest of the herd sought
their places inside the milking-barn.</p>

<p>The men, though, had no eyes for all this,
but bent their gaze fixedly on the road, down
at the bottom. For a long way this thoroughfare
was bordered by a row of tall poplars,
which, as we were placed, receded from the
vision in so straight a line that they seemed
one high, fat tree. Beyond these one saw only
a line of richer green, where the vine-wrapped
rail-fences cleft their way between the ripening
fields.</p>

<p>"I'd 'a' took my oath it was them," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Philleo. "I can spot them grays as fur's I can
see 'em. They turned by the school-house
there, or I'll eat it, school-ma'am 'n' all. And
the buggy was follerin' 'em, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought it was them," said Myron,
shading his eyes with his brown hand.</p>

<p>"But they ought to got past the poplars by
this time, then," remarked Warren.</p>

<p>"Why, they'll be drivin' as slow as molasses
in January," put in Si Hummaston. "When
you come to think of it, it <i>is</i> pretty nigh the
same as a regular funeral. You mark my
words, your father'll have walked them grays
every step of the road. I s'pose he'll drive
himself&mdash;he wouldn't trust bringin' Alvy home
to nobody else, would he? I know I wouldn't,
if the Lord had given <i>me</i> such a son; but then
he didn't!"</p>

<p>"No, He didn't!" commented the first
speaker, in an unnaturally loud tone of voice,
to break in upon the chance that Hi Tuckerman
was going to try to talk. But Hi only
stretched out his arm, pointing the forefinger
toward the poplars.</p>

<p>Sure enough, something was in motion down
at the base of the shadows on the road. Then
it crept forward, out in the sunlight, and separated
itself into two vehicles. A farm wagon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
came first, drawn by a team of gray horses.
Close after it followed a buggy, with its black
top raised. Both advanced so slowly that they
seemed scarcely to be moving at all.</p>

<p>"Well, I swan!" exclaimed Si Hummaston,
after a minute, "it's Dana Pillsbury drivin'
the wagon after all! Well&mdash;I dunno&mdash;yes,
I guess that's prob'bly what I'd 'a' done too,
if I'd b'n your father. Yes, it does look more
correct, his follerin' on behind, like that. I
s'pose that's Alvy's widder in the buggy there
with him."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's Serena&mdash;it looks like her little
girl with her," said Myron, gravely.</p>

<p>"I s'pose we might's well be movin' along
down," observed his brother, and at that we
all started.</p>

<p>We walked more slowly now, matching our
gait to the snail-like progress of those coming
toward us. As we drew near to the gate, the
three hired men instinctively fell behind the
brothers, and in that position the group halted
on the grass, facing our drive-way where it left
the main road. Not a word was uttered by
any one. When at last the wagon came up,
Myron and Warren took off their hats, and the
others followed suit, all holding them poised at
the level of their shoulders.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>Dana Pillsbury, carrying himself rigidly upright
on the box-seat, drove past us with eyes
fixed straight ahead, and a face as coldly expressionless
as that of a wooden Indian. The
wagon was covered all over with rubber blankets,
so that whatever it bore was hidden. Only
a few paces behind came the buggy, and my
grandfather, old Arphaxed Turnbull, went by
in his turn with the same averted, far-away
gaze, and the same resolutely stolid countenance.
He held the restive young carriage
horse down to a decorous walk, a single firm
hand on the tight reins, without so much as
looking at it. The strong yellow light of the
declining sun poured full upon his long gray
beard, his shaven upper lip, his dark-skinned,
lean, domineering face&mdash;and made me think of
some hard and gloomy old prophet seeing a
vision, in the back part of the Old Testament.
If that woman beside him, swathed in heavy
black raiment, and holding a child up against
her arm, was my Aunt Serena, I should never
have guessed it.</p>

<p>We put on our hats again, and walked up
the drive-way with measured step behind
the carriage till it stopped at the side-piazza
stoop. The wagon had passed on toward the
big new red barn&mdash;and crossing its course I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
saw my Aunt Em, bareheaded and with her
sleeves rolled up, going to the cow-barn with
a milking-pail in her hand. She was walking
quickly, as if in a great hurry.</p>

<p>"There's your Ma," I whispered to Marcellus,
assuming that he would share my surprise
at her rushing off like this, instead of waiting
to say 'How-d'-do' to Serena. He only
nodded knowingly, and said nothing.</p>

<p>No one else said much of anything. Myron
and Warren shook hands in stiff solemnity with
the veiled and craped sister-in-law, when their
father had helped her and her daughter from
the buggy, and one of them remarked in a constrained
way that the hot spell seemed to keep
up right along. The new comers ascended the
steps to the open door, and the woman and
child went inside. Old Arphaxed turned on
the threshold, and seemed to behold us for the
first time.</p>

<p>"After you've put out the horse," he said,
"I want the most of yeh to come up to the
new barn. Si Hummaston and Marcellus can
do the milkin'."</p>

<p>"I kind o' rinched my wrist this forenoon,"
put in Si, with a note of entreaty in his voice.
He wanted sorely to be one of the party at the
red barn.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>"Mebbe milkin' 'll be good for it," said
Arphaxed, curtly. "You and Marcellus do
what I say, and keep Sidney with you." With
this he, too, went into the house.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>


<p class="center bold in0 p3t p1b"><span class="large">II.</span></p>

<p>It wasn't an easy matter for even a member
of the family like myself to keep clearly and
untangled in his head all the relationships
which existed under this patriarchal Turnbull
roof.</p>

<p>Old Arphaxed had been married twice. His
first wife was the mother of two children, who
grew up, and the older of these was my father,
Wilbur Turnbull. He never liked farm-life,
and left home early, not without some hard
feeling, which neither father nor son ever quite
forgot. My father made a certain success of it
as a business man in Albany until, in the thirties,
his health broke down. He died when I
was seven and, although he left some property,
my mother was forced to supplement this help
by herself going to work as forewoman in a
large store. She was too busy to have much
time for visiting, and I don't think there was
any great love lost between her and the people
on the farm; but it was a good healthy place
for me to be sent to when the summer vacation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
came, and withal inexpensive, and so the first
of July each year generally found me out at the
homestead, where, indeed, nobody pretended
to be heatedly fond of me, but where I was
still treated well and enjoyed myself. This
year it was understood that my mother was
coming out to bring me home later on.</p>

<p>The other child of that first marriage was a
girl who was spoken of in youth as Emmeline,
but whom I knew now as Aunt Em. She was
a silent, tough-fibred, hard-working creature,
not at all good-looking, but relentlessly neat,
and the best cook I ever knew. Even when the
house was filled with extra hired men, no one
ever thought of getting in any female help, so
tireless and so resourceful was Em. She did
all the housework there was to do, from cellar
to garret, was continually lending a hand in the
men's chores, made more butter than the household
could eat up, managed a large kitchen-garden,
and still had a good deal of spare time,
which she spent in sitting out in the piazza in
a starched pink calico gown, knitting the while
she watched who went up and down the road.
When you knew her, you understood how it
was that the original Turnbulls had come into
that part of the country just after the Revolution,
and in a few years chopped down all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
forests, dug up all the stumps, drained the swale-lands,
and turned the entire place from a wilderness
into a flourishing and fertile home for
civilized people. I used to feel, when I looked
at her, that she would have been quite equal to
doing the whole thing herself.</p>

<p>All at once, when she was something over
thirty, Em had up and married a mowing-machine
agent named Abel Jones, whom no one
knew anything about, and who, indeed, had
only been in the neighborhood for a week or
so. The family was struck dumb with amazement.
The idea of Em's dallying with the
notion of matrimony had never crossed anybody's
mind. As a girl she had never had any
patience with husking-bees or dances or sleigh-ride
parties. No young man had ever seen her
home from anywhere, or had had the remotest
encouragement to hang around the house. She
had never been pretty&mdash;so my mother told me&mdash;and
as she got along in years grew dumpy
and thick in figure, with a plain, fat face, a
rather scowling brow, and an abrupt, ungracious
manner. She had no conversational gifts whatever,
and, through years of increasing taciturnity
and confirmed unsociability, built up in everybody's
mind the conviction that, if there could
be a man so wild and unsettled in intellect as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
to suggest a tender thought to Em, he would
get his ears cuffed off his head for his pains.</p>

<p>Judge, then, how like a thunderbolt the
episode of the mowing-machine agent fell
upon the family. To bewildered astonishment
there soon enough succeeded rage. This Jones
was a curly headed man, with a crinkly black
beard like those of Joseph's brethren in the
Bible picture. He had no home and no property,
and didn't seem to amount to much even
as a salesman of other people's goods. His
machine was quite the worst then in the market,
and it could not be learned that he had sold a
single one in the county. But he had married
Em, and it was calmly proposed that he should
henceforth regard the farm as his home. After
this point had been sullenly conceded, it turned
out that Jones was a widower, and had a boy
nine or ten years old, named Marcellus, who
was in a sort of orphan asylum in Vermont.
There were more angry scenes between father
and daughter, and a good deal more bad blood,
before it was finally agreed that the boy also
should come and live on the farm.</p>

<p>All this had happened in 1860 or 1861.
Jones had somewhat improved on acquaintance.
He knew about lightning-rods, and had been
able to fit out all the farm buildings with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
at cost price. He had turned a little money
now and again in trades with hop-poles, butter-firkins,
shingles, and the like, and he was very
ingenious in mending and fixing up odds and
ends. He made shelves and painted the woodwork,
and put a tar roof on the summer kitchen.
Even Martha, the second Mrs. Turnbull, came
finally to admit that he was handy about a
house.</p>

<p>This Martha became the head of the household
while Em was still a little girl. She was
a heavy woman, mentally as well as bodily,
rather prone to a peevish view of things, and
greatly given to pride in herself and her position,
but honest, charitable in her way, and not
unkindly at heart. On the whole she was a
good stepmother, and Em probably got on
quite as well with her as she would have done
with her own mother&mdash;even in the matter of
the mowing-machine agent.</p>

<p>To Martha three sons were born. The two
younger ones, Myron and Warren, have already
been seen. The eldest boy, Alva, was the
pride of the family, and, for that matter, of the
whole section.</p>

<p>Alva was the first Turnbull to go to college.
From his smallest boyhood it had been manifest
that he had great things before him, so handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
and clever and winning a lad was he.
Through each of his schooling years he was the
honor man of his class, and he finished in a blaze
of glory by taking the Clark Prize, and practically
everything else within reach in the way
of academic distinctions. He studied law at
Octavius, in the office of Judge Schermerhorn,
and in a little time was not only that distinguished
man's partner, but distinctly the more
important figure in the firm. At the age of
twenty-five he was sent to the Assembly. The
next year they made him District Attorney, and
it was quite understood that it rested with him
whether he should be sent to Congress later on,
or be presented by the Dearborn County bar
for the next vacancy on the Supreme Court
bench.</p>

<p>At this point in his brilliant career he married
Miss Serena Wadsworth, of Wadsworth's Falls.
The wedding was one of the most imposing
social events the county had known, so it was
said, since the visit of Lafayette. The Wadsworths
were an older family, even, than the
Fairchilds, and infinitely more fastidious and
refined. The daughters of the household, indeed,
carried their refinement to such a pitch
that they lived an almost solitary life, and
grew to the parlous verge of old-maidhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
simply because there was nobody good enough
to marry them. Alva Turnbull was, however,
up to the standard. It could not be said, of
course, that his home surroundings quite
matched those of his bride; but, on the other
hand, she was nearly two years his senior, and
this was held to make matters about even.</p>

<p>In a year or so came the War, and nowhere
in the North did patriotic excitement run
higher than in this old abolition stronghold of
upper Dearborn. Public meetings were held,
and nearly a whole regiment was raised in Octavius
and the surrounding towns alone. Alva
Turnbull made the most stirring and important
speech at the first big gathering, and sent a thrill
through the whole country side by claiming the
privilege of heading the list of volunteers. He
was made a captain by general acclaim, and
went off with his company in time to get chased
from the field of Bull Run. When he came
home on a furlough in 1863 he was a major,
and later on he rose to be lieutenant-colonel.
We understood vaguely that he might have
climbed vastly higher in promotion but for the
fact that he was too moral and conscientious to
get on very well with his immediate superior,
General Boyce, of Thessaly, who was notoriously
a drinking man.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>It was glory enough to have him at the farm,
on that visit of his, even as a major. His old
parents literally abased themselves at his feet,
quite tremulous in their awed pride at his greatness.
It made it almost too much to have
Serena there also, this fair, thin-faced, prim-spoken
daughter of the Wadsworths, and actually
to call her by her first name. It was haying
time, I remember, but the hired men that
year did not eat their meals with the family,
and there was even a question whether Marcellus
and I were socially advanced enough to
come to the table, where Serena and her husband
were feeding themselves in state with a
novel kind of silver implement called a four-tined
fork. If Em hadn't put her foot down,
out to the kitchen we should both have gone,
I fancy. As it was, we sat decorously at the
far end of the table, and asked with great politeness
to have things passed to us, which by
standing up we could have reached as well as
not. It was slow, but it made us feel immensely
respectable, almost as if we had been born
Wadsworths ourselves.</p>

<p>We agreed that Serena was "stuck up," and
Marcellus reported Aunt Em as feeling that
her bringing along with her a nursemaid to be
waited on hand and foot, just to take care of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
baby, was an imposition bordering upon the
intolerable. He said that that was the sort of
thing the English did until George Washington
rose and drove them out. But we both
felt that Alva was splendid.</p>

<p>He was a fine creature physically&mdash;taller even
than old Arphaxed, with huge square shoulders
and a mighty frame. I could recall him as
without whiskers, but now he had a waving
lustrous brown beard, the longest and biggest I
ever saw. He didn't pay much attention to us
boys, it was true; but he was affable when we
came in his way, and he gave Myron and Warren
each a dollar bill when they went to Octavius
to see the Fourth of July doings. In the
evening some of the more important neighbors
would drop in, and then Alva would talk about
the War, and patriotism, and saving the Union,
till it was like listening to Congress itself. He
had a rich, big voice which filled the whole
room, so that the hired men could hear every
word out in the kitchen; but it was even more
affecting to see him walking with his father
down under the poplars, with his hands making
orator's gestures as he spoke, and old Arphaxed
looking at him and listening with shining eyes.</p>

<p>Well, then, he and his wife went away to
visit her folks, and then we heard he had left to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
join his regiment. From time to time he wrote
to his father&mdash;letters full of high and loyal sentiments,
which were printed next week in the
Octavius <i>Transcript</i>, and the week after in the
Thessaly <i>Banner of Liberty</i>. Whenever any of
us thought about the War&mdash;and who thought
much of anything else?&mdash;it was always with
Alva as the predominant figure in every picture.</p>

<p>Sometimes the arrival of a letter for Aunt Em,
or a chance remark about a broken chair or a
clock hopelessly out of kilter, would recall for
the moment the fact that Abel Jones was also
at the seat of war. He had enlisted on that
very night when Alva headed the roll of honor,
and he had marched away in Alva's company.
Somehow he got no promotion, but remained
in the ranks. Not even the members of the
family were shown the letters Aunt Em received,
much less the printers of the newspapers.
They were indeed poor misspelled scrawls,
about which no one displayed any interest or
questioned Aunt Em. Even Marcellus rarely
spoke of his father, and seemed to share to the
full the family's concentration of thought upon
Alva.</p>

<p>Thus matters stood when spring began to
play at being summer in the year of '64. The
birds came and the trees burst forth into green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
the sun grew hotter and the days longer, the
strawberries hidden under the big leaves in our
yard started into shape, where the blossoms had
been, quite in the ordinary, annual way, with
us up North. But down where that dread thing
they called "The War" was going on, this
coming of warm weather meant more awful
massacre, more tortured hearts, and desolated
homes, than ever before. I can't be at all sure
how much later reading and associations have
helped out and patched up what seem to be my
boyish recollections of this period; but it is,
at all events, much clearer in my mind than
are the occurrences of the week before last.</p>

<p>We heard a good deal about how deep the
mud was in Virginia that spring. All the
photographs and tin-types of officers which
found their way to relatives at home, now,
showed them in boots that came up to their
thighs. Everybody understood that as soon as
this mud dried up a little, there were to be
most terrific doings. The two great lines of
armies lay scowling at each other, still on that
blood-soaked fighting ground between Washington
and Richmond where they were three
years before. Only now things were to go differently.
A new general was at the head of
affairs, and he was going in, with jaws set and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
nerves of steel, to smash, kill, burn, annihilate,
sparing nothing, looking not to right or left,
till the red road had been hewed through to
Richmond. In the first week of May this
thing began&mdash;a push forward all along the
line&mdash;and the North, with scared eyes and fluttering
heart, held its breath.</p>

<p>My chief personal recollection of those historic
forty days is that one morning I was
awakened early by a noise in my bedroom, and
saw my mother looking over the contents of
the big chest of drawers which stood against
the wall. She was getting out some black
articles of apparel. When she discovered that
I was awake, she told me in a low voice that
my Uncle Alva had been killed. Then a few
weeks later my school closed, and I was packed
off to the farm for the vacation. It will be
better to tell what had happened as I learned
it there from Marcellus and the others.</p>

<p>Along about the middle of May, the weekly
paper came up from Octavius, and old Arphaxed
Turnbull, as was his wont, read it over out on
the piazza before supper. Presently he called
his wife to him, and showed her something in
it. Martha went out into the kitchen, where
Aunt Em was getting the meal ready, and told
her, as gently as she could, that there was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
bad news for her; in fact, her husband, Abel
Jones, had been killed in the first day's battle
in the Wilderness, something like a week before.
Aunt Em said she didn't believe it, and Martha
brought in the paper and pointed out the fatal
line to her. It was not quite clear whether this
convinced Aunt Em or not. She finished getting
supper, and sat silently through the meal,
afterwards, but she went upstairs to her room
before family prayers. The next day she was
about as usual, doing the work and saying
nothing. Marcellus told me that to the best
of his belief no one had said anything to her
on the subject. The old people were a shade
more ceremonious in their manner toward her,
and "the boys" and the hired men were on
the lookout to bring in water for her from the
well, and to spare her as much as possible in
the routine of chores, but no one talked about
Jones. Aunt Em did not put on mourning.
She made a black necktie for Marcellus to wear
to church, but stayed away from meeting herself.</p>

<p>A little more than a fortnight afterwards,
Myron was walking down the road from the
meadows one afternoon, when he saw a man
on horseback coming up from the poplars, galloping
like mad in a cloud of dust. The two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
met at the gate. The man was one of the hired
helps of the Wadsworths, and he had ridden as
hard as he could pelt from the Falls, fifteen miles
away, with a message, which now he gave
Myron to read. Both man and beast dripped
sweat, and trembled with fatigued excitement.
The youngster eyed them, and then gazed
meditatively at the sealed envelope in his
hand.</p>

<p>"I s'pose you know what's inside?" he
asked, looking up at last.</p>

<p>The man in the saddle nodded, with a tell-tale
look on his face, and breathing heavily.</p>

<p>Myron handed the letter back, and pushed
the gate open. "You'd better go up and give
it to father yourself," he said. "I ain't got
the heart to face him&mdash;jest now, at any rate."</p>

<p>Marcellus was fishing that afternoon, over in
the creek which ran through the woods. Just as
at last he was making up his mind that it must
be about time to go after the cows, he saw
Myron sitting on a log beside the forest path,
whittling mechanically, and staring at the foliage
before him, in an obvious brown study.
Marcellus went up to him, and had to speak
twice before Myron turned his head and looked
up.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's you, eh, Bubb?" he remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
dreamily, and began gazing once more into the
thicket.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked the puzzled
boy.</p>

<p>"I guess Alvy's dead," replied Myron. To
the lad's comments and questions he made
small answer. "No," he said at last, "I don't
feel much like goin' home jest now. Lea' me
alone here; I'll prob'ly turn up later on." And
Marcellus went alone to the pasture, and thence,
at the tail of his bovine procession, home.</p>

<p>When he arrived he regretted not having remained
with Myron in the woods. It was like
coming into something which was prison, hospital,
and tomb in one. The household was
paralyzed with horror and fright. Martha had
gone to bed, or rather had been put there by
Em, and all through the night, when he woke
up, he heard her broken and hysterical voice in
moans and screams. The men had hitched up
the grays, and Arphaxed Turnbull was getting
into the buggy to drive to Octavius for news
when the boy came up. He looked twenty
years older than he had at noon&mdash;all at once
turned into a chalk-faced, trembling, infirm old
man&mdash;and could hardly see to put his foot on
the carriage-step. His son Warren had offered
to go with him, and had been rebuffed almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
with fierceness. Warren and the others silently
bowed their heads before this mood; instinct
told them that nothing but Arphaxed's show of
temper held him from collapse&mdash;from falling at
their feet and grovelling on the grass with cries
and sobs of anguish, perhaps even dying in a
fit. After he had driven off they forbore to
talk to one another, but went about noiselessly
with drooping chins and knotted brows.</p>

<p>"It jest took the tuck out of every thing,"
said Marcellus, relating these tragic events to
me. There was not much else to tell. Martha
had had what they call brain fever, and had
emerged from this some weeks afterward a
pallid and dim-eyed ghost of her former self,
sitting for hours together in her rocking-chair in
the unused parlor, her hands idly in her lap,
her poor thoughts glued ceaselessly to that vague,
far-off Virginia which folks told about as hot and
sunny, but which her mind's eye saw under the
gloom of an endless and dreadful night. Arphaxed
had gone South, still defiantly alone, to
bring back the body of his boy. An acquaintance
wrote to them of his being down sick in
Washington, prostrated by the heat and strange
water; but even from his sick-bed he had sent
on orders to an undertaking firm out at the
front, along with a hundred dollars, their price<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
in advance for embalming. Then, recovering,
he had himself pushed down to headquarters, or
as near them as civilians might approach, only
to learn that he had passed the precious freight
on the way. He posted back again, besieging
the railroad officials at every point with inquiries,
scolding, arguing, beseeching in turn,
until at last he overtook his quest at Juno Mills
Junction, only a score of miles from home.</p>

<p>Then only he wrote, telling people his plans.
He came first to Octavius, where a funeral service
was held in the forenoon, with military
honors, the Wadsworths as the principal mourners,
and a memorable turnout of distinguished
citizens. The town-hall was draped with mourning,
and so was Alva's pew in the Episcopal
Church, which he had deserted his ancestral
Methodism to join after his marriage. Old Arphaxed
listened to the novel burial service of his
son's communion, and watched the clergyman
in his curious white and black vestments, with
sombre pride. He himself needed and desired
only a plain and homely religion, but it was fitting
that his boy should have organ music and
flowers and a ritual.</p>

<p>Dana Pillsbury had arrived in town early in
the morning with the grays, and a neighbor's
boy had brought in the buggy. Immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
after dinner Arphaxed had gathered up Alva's
widow and little daughter, and started the funeral
cort&egrave;ge upon its final homeward stage.</p>

<p>And so I saw them arrive on that July afternoon.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>


<p class="center bold in0 p3t p1b"><span class="large">III.</span></p>

<p>For so good and patient a man, Si Hummaston
bore himself rather vehemently during
the milking. It was hotter in the barn than it
was outside in the sun, and the stifling air
swarmed with flies, which seemed to follow Si
perversely from stall to stall and settle on his
cow. One beast put her hoof square in his pail,
and another refused altogether to "give down,"
while the rest kept up a tireless slapping and
swishing of their tails very hard to bear, even if
one had the help of profanity. Marcellus and I
listened carefully to hear him at last provoked to
an oath, but the worst thing he uttered, even
when the cow stepped in the milk, was "Dum
your buttons!" which Marcellus said might
conceivably be investigated by a church committee,
but was hardly out-and-out swearing.</p>

<p>I remember Si's groans and objurgations,
his querulous "Hyst there, will ye!" his hypocritical
"So-boss! So-boss!" his despondent
"They never will give down for me!"
because presently there was crossed upon this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
woof of peevish impatience the web of a curious
conversation.</p>

<p>Si had been so slow in his headway against
flapping tails and restive hoofs that, before he
had got up to the end of the row, Aunt Em
had finished her side. She brought over her
stool and pail, and seated herself at the next
cow to Hummaston's. For a little, one heard
only the resonant din of the stout streams
against the tin; then, as the bottom was covered,
there came the ploughing plash of milk
on milk, and Si could hear himself talk.</p>

<p>"S'pose you know S'reny's come, 'long
with your father," he remarked, ingratiatingly.</p>

<p>"I saw 'em drive in," replied Em.</p>

<p>"<i>Whoa! Hyst there! Hole still, can't
ye?</i> I didn't know if you quite made out who
she was, you was scootin' 'long so fast. They
ain't&mdash;<i>Whoa there!</i>&mdash;they ain't nothin' the
matter 'twixt you and her, is they?"</p>

<p>"I don't know as there is," said Em, curtly.
"The world's big enough for both of us&mdash;we
ain't no call to bunk into each other."</p>

<p>"No, of course&mdash;<i>Now you stop it!</i>&mdash;but it
looked kind o' curious to me, your pikin' off
like that, without waitin' to say 'How-d'-do?'
Of course, I never had no relation by marriage
that was stuck-up at all, or looked down on me&mdash;<i>Stiddy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
there now!</i>&mdash;but I guess I can reelize
pretty much how you feel about it. I'm a
good deal of a hand at that. It's what they
call imagination. It's a gift, you know, like
good looks, or preachin', or the knack o'
makin' money. But you can't help what
you're born with, can you? I'd been a heap
better off if my gift 'd be'n in some other direction;
but, as I tell 'em, it ain't my fault.
And my imagination&mdash;<i>Hi, there! git over,
will ye?</i>&mdash;it's downright cur'ous sometimes,
how it works. Now I could tell, you see, that
you 'n S'reny didn't pull together. I s'pose
she never writ a line to you, when your husband
was killed?"</p>

<p>"Why should she?" demanded Em. "We
never did correspond. What'd be the sense of
beginning then? She minds her affairs, 'n I
mind mine. Who wanted her to write?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course not," said Si, lightly.
"Prob'ly you'll get along better together,
though, now that you'll see more of one another.
I s'pose S'reny's figurin' on stayin' here right
along now, her 'n' her little girl. Well, it'll be
nice for the old folks to have somebody they're
fond of. They jest worshipped the ground
Alvy walked on&mdash;and I s'pose they won't be
anything in this wide world too good for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
little girl of his. Le's see, she must be comin'
on three now, ain't she?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about her!"
snapped Aunt Em, with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Of course, it's natural the old folks should
feel so&mdash;she bein' Alvy's child. I hain't noticed
anything special, but does it&mdash;<i>Well, I
swan! Hyst there!</i>&mdash;does it seem to you that
they're as good to Marcellus, quite, as they used
to be? I don't hear 'em sayin' nothin' about
his goin' to school next winter."</p>

<p>Aunt Em said nothing, too, but milked doggedly
on. Si told her about the thickness and
profusion of Serena's mourning, guardedly hinted
at the injustice done him by not allowing
him to go to the red barn with the others,
speculated on the likelihood of the Wadsworths'
contributing to their daughter's support, and
generally exhibited his interest in the family
through a monologue which finished only with
the milking; but Aunt Em made no response
whatever.</p>

<p>When the last pails had been emptied into
the big cans at the door&mdash;Marcellus and I had
let the cows out one by one into the yard, as
their individual share in the milking ended&mdash;Si
and Em saw old Arphaxed wending his way
across from the house to the red barn. He appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
more bent than ever, but he walked with
a slowness which seemed born of reluctance
even more than of infirmity.</p>

<p>"Well, now," mused Si, aloud, "Brother
Turnbull an' me's be'n friends for a good long
spell. I don't believe he'd be mad if I cut
over now to the red barn too, seem' the milkin's
all out of the way. Of course I don't
want to do what ain't right&mdash;what d'you think
now, Em, honest? Think it 'ud rile him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about it!" my
aunt replied, with increased vigor of emphasis.
"But for the land sake go somewhere! Don't
hang around botherin' me. I got enough else
to think of besides your everlasting cackle."</p>

<p>Thus rebuffed, Si meandered sadly into the
cow-yard, shaking his head as he came. Seeing
us seated on an upturned plough, over by the
fence, from which point we had a perfect view
of the red barn, he sauntered toward us, and,
halting at our side, looked to see if there was
room enough for him to sit also. But Marcellus,
in quite a casual way, remarked, "Oh!
wheeled the milk over to the house, already,
Si?" and at this the doleful man lounged off
again in new despondency, got out the wheelbarrow,
and, with ostentatious groans of travail
hoisted a can upon it and started off.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>"He's takin' advantage of Arphaxed's being
so worked up to play 'ole soldier' on him,"
said Marcellus. "All of us have to stir him
up the whole time to keep him from takin' root
somewhere. I told him this afternoon 't' if
there had to be any settin' around under the
bushes an' cryin', the fam'ly 'ud do it."</p>

<p>We talked in hushed tones as we sat there
watching the shut doors of the red barn, in
boyish conjecture about what was going on behind
them. I recall much of this talk with curious
distinctness, but candidly it jars now upon
my maturer nerves. The individual man looks
back upon his boyhood with much the same
amused amazement that the race feels in contemplating
the memorials of its own cave-dwelling
or bronze period. What strange savages
we were! In those days Marcellus and I used
to find our very highest delight in getting off
on Thursdays, and going over to Dave Bushnell's
slaughter-house, to witness with stony
hearts, and from as close a coign of vantage as
might be, the slaying of some score of barnyard
animals&mdash;the very thought of which now revolts
our grown-up minds. In the same way we sat
there on the plough, and criticised old Arphaxed's
meanness in excluding us from the red
barn, where the men-folks were coming in final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
contact with the "pride of the family." Some
of the cows wandering toward us began to
"moo" with impatience for the pasture, but
Marcellus said there was no hurry.</p>

<p>All at once we discovered that Aunt Em was
standing a few yards away from us, on the other
side of the fence. We could see her from where
we sat by only turning a little&mdash;a motionless,
stout, upright figure, with a pail in her hand,
and a sternly impassive look on her face. She,
too, had her gaze fixed upon the red barn, and,
though the declining sun was full in her eyes,
seemed incapable of blinking, but just stared
coldly, straight ahead.</p>

<p>Suddenly an unaccustomed voice fell upon
our ears. Turning, we saw that a black-robed
woman, with a black wrap of some sort about
her head, had come up to where Aunt Em
stood, and was at her shoulder. Marcellus
nudged me, and whispered, "It's S'reny.
Look out for squalls!" And then we listened
in silence.</p>

<p>"Won't you speak to me at all, Emmeline?"
we heard this new voice say.</p>

<p>Aunt Em's face, sharply outlined in profile
against the sky, never moved. Her lips were
pressed into a single line, and she kept her eyes
on the barn.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>"If there's anything I've done, tell me,"
pursued the other. "In such an hour as this&mdash;when
both our hearts are bleeding so, and&mdash;and
every breath we draw is like a curse upon us&mdash;it
doesn't seem a fit time for us&mdash;for us to&mdash;&mdash;"
The voice faltered and broke, leaving the
speech unfinished.</p>

<p>Aunt Em kept silence so long that we fancied
this appeal, too, had failed. Then abruptly,
and without moving her head, she dropped a
few ungracious words as it were over her shoulder,
"If I had anything special to say, most
likely I'd say it," she remarked.</p>

<p>We could hear the sigh that Serena drew.
She lifted her shawled head, and for a moment
seemed as if about to turn. Then she changed
her mind, apparently, for she took a step nearer
to the other.</p>

<p>"See here, Emmeline," she said, in a more
confident tone. "Nobody in the world knows
better than I do how thoroughly good a woman
you are, how you have done your duty, and
more than your duty, by your parents and your
brothers, and your little step-son. You have
never spared yourself for them, day or night. I
have said often to&mdash;to him who has gone&mdash;that
I didn't believe there was anywhere on earth a
worthier or more devoted woman than you, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
sister. And&mdash;now that he is gone&mdash;and we are
both more sisters than ever in affliction&mdash;why
in Heaven's name should you behave like this
to me?"</p>

<p>Aunt Em spoke more readily this time. "I
don't know as I've done anything to you," she
said in defence. "I've just let you alone, that's
all. An' that's doin' as I'd like to be done
by." Still she did not turn her head, or lift
her steady gaze from those closed doors.</p>

<p>"Don't let us split words!" entreated the
other, venturing a thin, white hand upon Aunt
Em's shoulder. "That isn't the way we two
ought to stand to each other. Why, you were
friendly enough when I was here before. Can't
it be the same again? What has happened to
change it? Only to-day, on our way up here,
I was speaking to your father about you, and
my deep sympathy for you, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Aunt Em wheeled like a flash. "Yes, 'n'
what did <i>he</i> say? Come, don't make up anything!
Out with it! What did he say?" She
shook off the hand on her shoulder as she spoke.</p>

<p>Gesture and voice and frowning vigor of
mien were all so imperative and rough that they
seemed to bewilder Serena. She, too, had
turned now, so that I could see her wan and
delicate face, framed in the laced festoons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
black, like the fabulous countenance of "The
Lady I&ntilde;ez" in my mother's "Album of
Beauty." She bent her brows in hurried
thought, and began stammering, "Well, he
said&mdash;Let's see&mdash;he said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" broke in Aunt Em, with
raucous irony, "I know well enough what he
said! He said I was a good worker&mdash;that
they'd never had to have a hired girl since I
was big enough to wag a churn dash, an' they
wouldn't known what to do without me. I know
all that; I've heard it on an' off for twenty
years. What I'd like to hear is, did he tell you
that he went down South to bring back <i>your</i>
husband, an' that he never so much as give a
thought to fetchin' <i>my</i> husband, who was just
as good a soldier and died just as bravely as
yours did? I'd like to know&mdash;did he tell
you that?"</p>

<p>What could Serena do but shake her head,
and bow it in silence before this bitter gale of
words?</p>

<p>"An' tell me this, too," Aunt Em went on,
lifting her harsh voice mercilessly, "when you
was settin' there in church this forenoon, with
the soldiers out, an' the bells tollin' an' all
that&mdash;did he say 'This is some for Alvy, an'
some for Abel, who went to the war together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
an' was killed together, or within a month o'
one another?' Did he say that, or look for
one solitary minute as if he thought it? I'll
bet he didn't!"</p>

<p>Serena's head sank lower still, and she put up,
in a blinded sort of a way, a little white handkerchief
to her eyes. "But why blame <i>me</i>?"
she asked.</p>

<p>Aunt Em heard her own voice so seldom
that the sound of it now seemed to intoxicate
her. "No!" she shouted. "It's like the
Bible. One was taken an' the other left. It
was always Alvy this, an' Alvy that, nothin' for
any one but Alvy. That was all right; nobody
complained: prob'ly he deserved it all; at any
rate, we didn't begrudge him any of it, while
he was livin'. But there ought to be a limit
somewhere. When a man's dead, he's pretty
much about on an equality with other dead
men, one would think. But it ain't so. One
man gets hunted after when he's shot, an'
there's a hundred dollars for embalmin' him an'
a journey after him, an' bringin' him home,
an' two big funerals, an' crape for his widow
that'd stand by itself. The <i>other</i> man&mdash;he can
lay where he fell! Them that's lookin' for the
first one are right close by&mdash;it ain't more'n a
few miles from the Wilderness to Cold Harbor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
so Hi Tuckerman tells me, an' he was all over
the ground two years ago&mdash;but nobody looks
for this other man! Oh, no! Nobody so much
as remembers to think of him! They ain't no
hundred dollars, no, not so much as fifty cents,
for embalmin' <i>him</i>! No&mdash;<i>he</i> could be shovelled
in anywhere, or maybe burned up when the
woods got on fire that night, the night of
the sixth. They ain't no funeral for him&mdash;no
bells tolled&mdash;unless it may be a cowbell up
in the pasture that he hammered out himself.
An' <i>his</i> widow can go around, week days an'
Sundays, in her old calico dresses. Nobody
ever mentions the word 'mournin' crape' to
her, or asks her if she'd like to put on black. I
'spose they thought if they gave me the money
for some mournin' I'd buy <i>candy</i> with it instead!"</p>

<p>With this climax of flaming sarcasm Aunt Em
stopped, her eyes aglow, her thick breast heaving
in a flurry of breathlessness. She had never
talked so much or so fast before in her life. She
swung the empty tin-pail now defiantly at her
side to hide the fact that her arms were shaking
with excitement. Every instant it looked as if
she was going to begin again.</p>

<p>Serena had taken the handkerchief down from
her eyes and held her arms stiff and straight by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
her side. Her chin seemed to have grown
longer or to be thrust forward more. When she
spoke, it was in a colder voice&mdash;almost mincing
in the way it cut off the words.</p>

<p>"All this is not my doing," she said. "I
am to blame for nothing of it. As I tried to
tell you, I sympathize deeply with your grief.
But grief ought to make people at least fair,
even if it cannot make them gentle and soften
their hearts. I shall trouble you with no more
offers of friendship. I&mdash;I think I will go back
to the house now&mdash;to my little girl."</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, there came from the direction
of the red barn a shrill, creaking noise
which we all knew. At the sound Marcellus
and I stood up, and Serena forgot her intention
to go away. The barn doors, yelping as they
moved on their dry rollers, had been pushed
wide open.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>


<p class="center bold in0 p3t p1b"><span class="large">IV.</span></p>

<p>The first one to emerge from the barn was
Hi Tuckerman. He started to make for the
house, but, when he caught sight of our group,
came running toward us at the top of his speed,
uttering incoherent shouts as he advanced, and
waving his arms excitedly. It was apparent that
something out of the ordinary had happened.</p>

<p>We were but little the wiser as to this something,
when Hi had come to a halt before us,
and was pouring out a volley of explanations,
accompanied by earnest grimaces and strenuous
gestures. Even Marcellus could make next to
nothing of what he was trying to convey; but
Aunt Em, strangely enough, seemed to understand
him. Still slightly trembling, and with
a little occasional catch in her breath, she bent
an intent scrutiny upon Hi, and nodded comprehendingly
from time to time, with encouraging
exclamations, "He did, eh!" "Is that
so?" and "I expected as much." Listening
and watching, I formed the uncharitable conviction
that she did not really understand Hi at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
all, but was only pretending to do so in order
further to harrow Serena's feelings.</p>

<p>Doubtless I was wrong, for presently she
turned, with an effort, to her sister-in-law, and
remarked, "P'rhaps you don't quite follow
what he's sayin'?"</p>

<p>"Not a word!" said Serena, eagerly.
"Tell me, please, Emmeline!"</p>

<p>Aunt Em seemed to hesitate. "He was shot
through the mouth at Gaines's Mills, you know&mdash;that's
right near Cold Harbor and&mdash;the
Wilderness," she said, obviously making talk.</p>

<p>"That isn't what he's saying," broke in
Serena. "What <i>is</i> it, Emmeline?"</p>

<p>"Well," rejoined the other, after an instant's
pause, "if you want to know&mdash;he says that it
ain't Alvy at all that they've got there in the
barn."</p>

<p>Serena turned swiftly, so that we could not
see her face.</p>

<p>"He says it's some strange man," continued
Em, "a yaller-headed man, all packed an'
stuffed with charcoal, so't his own mother
wouldn't know him. Who it is nobody knows,
but it ain't Alvy."</p>

<p>"They're a pack of robbers 'n' swindlers!"
cried old Arphaxed, shaking his long gray
beard with wrath.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>He had come up without our noticing his
approach, so rapt had been our absorption in
the strange discovery reported by Hi Tuckerman.
Behind him straggled the boys and the
hired men, whom Si Hummaston had scurried
across from the house to join. No one said
anything now, but tacitly deferred to the old
man's principal right to speak. It was a relief
to hear that terrible silence of his broken at
all.</p>

<p>"They ought to all be hung!" he cried, in
a voice to which the excess of passion over
physical strength gave a melancholy quaver.
"I paid 'em what they asked&mdash;they took a
hundred dollars o' my money&mdash;an' they ain't
sent me <i>him</i> at all! There I went, at my age,
all through the Wilderness, almost clear to Cold
Harbor, an' that, too, gittin up from a sick
bed in Washington, and then huntin' for the box
at New York an' Albany, an' all the way back,
an' holdin' a funeral over it only this very day&mdash;an'
here it ain't <i>him</i> at all! I'll have the law
on 'em though, if it costs the last cent I've got
in the world!"</p>

<p>Poor old man! These weeks of crushing
grief and strain had fairly broken him down.
We listened to his fierce outpourings with sympathetic
silence, almost thankful that he had left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
strength and vitality enough still to get angry
and shout. He had been always a hard and
gusty man; we felt by instinct, I suppose, that
his best chance of weathering this terrible month
of calamity was to batter his way furiously
through it, in a rage with everything and everybody.</p>

<p>"If there's any justice in the land," put in
Si Hummaston, "you'd ought to get your hundred
dollars back. I shouldn't wonder if you
could, too, if you sued 'em afore a Jestice that
was a friend of yours."</p>

<p>"Why, the man's a fool!" burst forth
Arphaxed, turning toward him with a snort.
"I don't want the hundred dollars&mdash;I wouldn't
'a' begrudged a thousand&mdash;if only they'd dealt
honestly by me. I paid 'em their own figure,
without beatin' 'em down a penny. If it'd be'n
double, I'd 'a' paid it. What <i>I</i> wanted was <i>my
boy</i>! It ain't so much their cheatin' <i>me</i> I
mind, either, if it 'd be'n about anything else.
But to think of Alvy&mdash;<i>my boy</i>&mdash;after all the
trouble I took, an' the journey, an' my sickness
there among strangers&mdash;to think that after it all
he's buried down there, no one knows where,
p'raps in some trench with private soldiers,
shovelled in anyhow&mdash;oh-h! they ought to be
hung!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>The two women had stood motionless, with
their gaze on the grass; Aunt Em lifted her
head at this.</p>

<p>"If a place is good enough for private soldiers
to be buried in," she said, vehemently,
"it's good enough for the best man in the
army. On Resurrection Day, do you think
them with shoulder-straps 'll be called fust an'
given all the front places? I reckon the men
that carried a musket are every whit as good,
there in the trench, as them that wore swords.
They gave their lives as much as the others did,
an' the best man that ever stepped couldn't do
no more."</p>

<p>Old Arphaxed bent upon her a long look,
which had in it much surprise and some elements
of menace. Reflection seemed, however,
to make him think better of an attack on
Aunt Em. He went on, instead, with rambling
exclamations to his auditors at large.</p>

<p>"Makin' me the butt of the whole county!"
he cried. "There was that funeral to-day&mdash;with
a parade an' a choir of music an' so on:
an' now it 'll come out in the papers that it
wasn't Alvy at all I brought back with me, but
only some perfect stranger&mdash;by what you can
make out from his clothes, not even an officer
at all. I tell you the War's a jedgment on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
country for its wickedness, for its cheatin' an'
robbin' of honest men! They wa'n't no sense
in that battle at Cold Harbor anyway&mdash;everybody
admits that! It was murder an' massacre
in cold blood&mdash;fifty thousand men
mowed down, an' nothin' gained by it! An'
then not even to git my boy's dead body back!
I say hangings too good for 'em!"</p>

<p>"Yes, father," said Myron, soothingly;
"but do you stick to what you said about the&mdash;the
box? Wouldn't it look better&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>No!</i>" shouted Arphaxed, with emphasis.
"Let Dana do what I told him&mdash;take it down
this very night to the poor master, an' let him
bury it where he likes. It's no affair of mine.
I wash my hands of it. There won't be no
funeral held here!"</p>

<p>It was then that Serena spoke. Strangely
enough, old Arphaxed had not seemed to notice
her presence in our group, and his jaw
visibly dropped as he beheld her now standing
before him. He made a gesture signifying his
disturbance at finding her among his hearers,
and would have spoken, but she held up her
hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard it all," she said, in answer to
his deprecatory movement. "I am glad I did.
It has given me time to get over the shock of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
learning&mdash;our mistake&mdash;and it gives me the
chance now to say something which I&mdash;I
feel keenly. The poor man you have brought
home was, you say, a private soldier. Well,
isn't this a good time to remember that there
was a private soldier who went out from this
farm&mdash;belonging right to this family&mdash;and who,
as a private, laid down his life as nobly as
General Sedgwick or General Wadsworth, or
even our dear Alva, or any one else? I never
met Emmeline's husband, but Alva liked him,
and spoke to me often of him. Men who fall
in the ranks don't get identified, or brought
home, but they deserve funerals as much as the
others&mdash;just as much. Now, this is my idea:
let us feel that the mistake which has brought
this poor stranger to us is God's way of giving
us a chance to remember and do honor to Abel
Jones. Let him be buried in the family lot up
yonder, where we had thought to lay Alva,
and let us do it reverently, in the name of
Emmeline's husband, and of all others who
have fought and died for our country, and
with sympathy in our hearts for the women
who, somewhere in the North, are mourning,
just as we mourn here, for the stranger there in
the red barn."</p>

<p>Arphaxed had watched her intently. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
nodded now, and blinked at the moisture
gathering in his old eyes. "I could e'en
a'most 'a' thought it was Alvy talkin'," was
what he said. Then he turned abruptly, but
we all knew, without further words, that what
Serena had suggested was to be done.</p>

<p>The men-folk, wondering doubtless much
among themselves, moved slowly off toward the
house or the cow-barns, leaving the two women
alone. A minute of silence passed before we
saw Serena creep gently up to Aunt Em's side,
and lay the thin white hand again upon her
shoulder. This time it was not shaken off,
but stretched itself forward, little by little,
until its palm rested against Aunt Em's further
cheek. We heard the tin-pail fall resonantly
against the stones under the rail-fence, and
there was a confused movement as if the two
women were somehow melting into one.</p>

<p>"Come on, Sid!" said Marcellus Jones to
me; "let's start them cows along. If there's
anything I hate to see it's women cryin' on
each other's necks."</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p1t p3t newpage"><span class="large">THE EVE OF THE FOURTH</span></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> was well on toward evening before this
Third of July all at once made itself gloriously
different from other days in my mind.</p>

<p>There was a very long afternoon, I remember,
hot and overcast, with continual threats
of rain, which never came to anything. The
other boys were too excited about the morrow
to care for present play. They sat instead
along the edge of the broad platform-stoop in
front of Delos Ingersoll's grocery-store, their
brown feet swinging at varying heights above
the sidewalk, and bragged about the manner in
which they contemplated celebrating the anniversary
of their Independence. Most of the
elder lads were very independent indeed; they
were already secure in the parental permission
to stay up all night, so that the Fourth might
be ushered in with its full quota of ceremonial.
The smaller urchins pretended that they also
had this permission, or were sure of getting it.
Little Denny Cregan attracted admiring attention
by vowing that he should remain out, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
if his father chased him with a policeman all
around the ward, and he had to go and live in
a cave in the gulf until he was grown up.</p>

<p>My inferiority to these companions of mine
depressed me. They were allowed to go without
shoes and stockings; they wore loose and
comfortable old clothes, and were under no
responsibility to keep them dry or clean or
whole; they had their pockets literally bulging
now with all sorts of portentous engines of noise
and racket&mdash;huge brown "double-enders,"
bound with waxed cord; long, slim, vicious-looking
"nigger-chasers;" big "Union torpedoes,"
covered with clay, which made a report
like a horse-pistol, and were invaluable for
frightening farmers' horses; and so on through
an extended catalogue of recondite and sinister
explosives upon which I looked with awe, as
their owners from time to time exhibited them
with the proud simplicity of those accustomed
to greatness. Several of these boys also possessed
toy cannons, which would be brought
forth at twilight. They spoke firmly of ramming
them to the muzzle with grass, to produce
a greater noise&mdash;even if it burst them and killed
everybody.</p>

<p>By comparison, my lot was one of abasement.
I was a solitary child, and a victim to conventions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
A blue necktie was daily pinned under
my Byron collar, and there were gilt buttons on
my zouave jacket. When we were away in the
pasture playground near the gulf, and I ventured
to take off my foot-gear, every dry old
thistle-point in the whole territory seemed to
arrange itself to be stepped upon by my whitened
and tender soles. I could not swim; so,
while my lithe bold comrades dived out of
sight under the deep water, and darted about
chasing one another far beyond their depth, I
paddled ignobly around the "baby-hole"
close to the bank, in the warm and muddy
shallows.</p>

<p>Especially apparent was my state of humiliation
on this July afternoon. I had no "double-enders,"
nor might hope for any. The mere
thought of a private cannon seemed monstrous
and unnatural to me. By some unknown process
of reasoning my mother had years before
reached the theory that a good boy ought to
have two ten-cent packs of small fire-crackers
on the Fourth of July. Four or five succeeding
anniversaries had hardened this theory into
an orthodox tenet of faith, with all its observances
rigidly fixed. The fire-crackers were
bought for me overnight, and placed on the
hall table. Beside them lay a long rod of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
punk. When I hastened down and out in the
morning, with these ceremonial implements in
my hands, the hired girl would give me, in an
old kettle, some embers from the wood-fire in
the summer kitchen. Thus furnished, I went
into the front yard, and in solemn solitude fired
off these crackers one by one. Those which,
by reason of having lost their tails, were only
fit for "fizzes," I saved till after breakfast.
With the exhaustion of these, I fell reluctantly
back upon the public for entertainment. I
could see the soldiers, hear the band and the
oration, and in the evening, if it didn't rain,
enjoy the fireworks; but my own contribution
to the patriotic noise was always over before
the breakfast dishes had been washed.</p>

<p>My mother scorned the little paper torpedoes
as flippant and wasteful things. You merely
threw one of them, and it went off, she said,
and there you were. I don't know that I ever
grasped this objection in its entirety, but it impressed
my whole childhood with its unanswerableness.
Years and years afterward, when my
own children asked for torpedoes, I found myself
unconsciously advising against them on
quite the maternal lines. Nor was it easy to
budge the good lady from her position on the
great two-packs issue. I seem to recall having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
successfully undermined it once or twice, but
two was the rule. When I called her attention
to the fact that our neighbor, Tom Hemingway,
thought nothing of exploding a whole
pack at a time inside their wash-boiler, she was
not dazzled, but only replied: "Wilful waste
makes woful want."</p>

<p>Of course the idea of the Hemingways ever
knowing what want meant was absurd. They
lived a dozen doors or so from us, in a big
white house with stately white columns rising
from veranda to gable across the whole front,
and a large garden, flowers and shrubs in front,
fruit-trees and vegetables behind. Squire Hemingway
was the most important man in our part
of the town. I know now that he was never
anything more than United States Commissioner
of Deeds, but in those days, when he walked
down the street with his gold-headed cane, his
blanket-shawl folded over his arm, and his
severe, dignified, close-shaven face held well
up in the air, I seemed to behold a companion
of Presidents.</p>

<p>This great man had two sons. The elder
of them, De Witt Hemingway, was a man
grown, and was at the front. I had seen
him march away, over a year before, with a
bright drawn sword, at the side of his company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
The other son, Tom, was my senior by
only a twelvemonth. He was by nature proud,
but often consented to consort with me when
the selection of other available associates was
at low ebb.</p>

<p>It was to this Tom that I listened with most
envious eagerness, in front of the grocery-store,
on the afternoon of which I speak. He did
not sit on the stoop with the others&mdash;no one
expected quite that degree of condescension&mdash;but
leaned nonchalantly against a post, whittling
out a new ramrod for his cannon. He
said that this year he was not going to have
any ordinary fire-crackers at all; they, he added
with a meaning glance at me, were only fit for
girls. He might do a little in "double-enders,"
but his real point would be in "ringers"&mdash;an
incredible giant variety of cracker, Turkey-red
like the other, but in size almost a rolling-pin.
Some of these he would fire off singly,
between volleys from his cannon. But a good
many he intended to explode, in bunches say
of six, inside the tin wash-boiler, brought out
into the middle of the road for that purpose.
It would doubtless blow the old thing sky-high,
but that didn't matter. They could get a new
one.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, the big bell in the tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
of the town-hall burst forth in a loud clangor
of swift-repeated strokes. It was half a mile
away, but the moist air brought the urgent,
clamorous sounds to our ears as if the belfry
had stood close above us. We sprang off the
stoop and stood poised, waiting to hear the
number of the ward struck, and ready to scamper
off on the instant if the fire was anywhere
in our part of the town. But the excited peal
went on and on, without a pause. It became
obvious that this meant something besides a fire.
Perhaps some of us wondered vaguely what that
something might be, but as a body our interest
had lapsed. Billy Norris, who was the son of
poor parents, but could whip even Tom Hemingway,
said he had been told that the German
boys on the other side of the gulf were coming
over to "rush" us on the following day, and
that we ought all to collect nails to fire at them
from our cannon. This we pledged ourselves
to do&mdash;the bell keeping up its throbbing tumult
ceaselessly.</p>

<p>Suddenly we saw the familiar figure of Johnson
running up the street toward us. What his
first name was I never knew. To every one,
little or big, he was just Johnson. He and his
family had moved into our town after the War
began; I fancy they moved away again before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
it ended. I do not even know what he did for
a living. But he seemed always drunk, always
turbulently good-natured, and always shouting
out the news at the top of his lungs. I cannot
pretend to guess how he found out everything
as he did, or why, having found it out, he
straightway rushed homeward, scattering the intelligence
as he ran. Most probably Johnson
was moulded by Nature for a town-crier, but
was born by accident some generations after the
race of bellmen had disappeared. Our neighborhood
did not like him; our mothers did
not know Mrs. Johnson, and we boys behaved
with snobbish roughness to his children. He
seemed not to mind this at all, but came up
unwearyingly to shout out the tidings of the
day for our benefit.</p>

<p>"Vicksburg's fell! Vicksburg's fell!" was
what we heard him yelling as he approached.</p>

<p>Delos Ingersoll and his hired boy ran out of
the grocery. Doors opened along the street
and heads were thrust inquiringly out.</p>

<p>"Vicksburg's fell!" he kept hoarsely proclaiming,
his arms waving in the air, as he
staggered along at a dog-trot past us, and went
into the saloon next to the grocery.</p>

<p>I cannot say how definite an idea these tidings
conveyed to our boyish minds. I have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
notion that at the time I assumed that Vicksburg
had something to do with Gettysburg,
where I knew, from the talk of my elders, that an
awful fight had been proceeding since the middle
of the week. Doubtless this confusion was
aided by the fact that an hour or so later, on
that same wonderful day, the wire brought us
word that this terrible battle on Pennsylvanian
soil had at last taken the form of a Union victory.
It is difficult now to see how we could
have known both these things on the Third of
July&mdash;that is to say, before the people actually
concerned seemed to have been sure of them.
Perhaps it was only inspired guesswork, but I
know that my town went wild over the news,
and that the clouds overhead cleared away as
if by magic.</p>

<p>The sun did well to spread that summer sky
at eventide with all the pageantry of color the
spectrum knows. It would have been preposterous
that such a day should slink off in dull,
Quaker drabs. Men were shouting in the
streets now. The old cannon left over from
the Mexican war had been dragged out on to
the rickety covered river-bridge, and was
frightening the fishes, and shaking the dry,
worm-eaten rafters, as fast as the swab and rammer
could work. Our town bandsmen were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
playing as they had never played before, down
in the square in front of the post-office. The
management of the Universe could not hurl
enough wild fireworks into the exultant sunset
to fit our mood.</p>

<p>The very air was filled with the scent of triumph&mdash;the
spirit of conquest. It seemed only
natural that I should march off to my mother
and quite collectedly tell her that I desired to
stay out all night with the other boys. I had
never dreamed of daring to prefer such a request
in other years. Now I was scarcely conscious
of surprise when she gave her permission,
adding with a smile that I would be glad
enough to come in and go to bed before half
the night was over.</p>

<p>I steeled my heart after supper with the
proud resolve that if the night turned out to
be as protracted as one of those Lapland winter
nights we read about in the geography, I still
would not surrender.</p>

<p>The boys outside were not so excited over
the tidings of my unlooked-for victory as I had
expected them to be. They received the news,
in fact, with a rather mortifying stoicism. Tom
Hemingway, however, took enough interest in
the affair to suggest that, instead of spending
my twenty cents in paltry fire-crackers, I might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
go down town and buy another can of powder
for his cannon. By doing so, he pointed out, I
would be a part-proprietor, as it were, of the
night's performance, and would be entitled to
occasionally touch the cannon off. This generosity
affected me, and I hastened down the
long hill-street to show myself worthy of it, repeating
the instruction of "Kentucky Bear-Hunter-coarse-grain"
over and over again to
myself as I went.</p>

<p>Half-way on my journey I overtook a person
whom, even in the gathering twilight, I
recognized as Miss Stratford, the schoolteacher.
She also was walking down the hill,
and rapidly. It did not need the sight of a
letter in her hand to tell me that she was going
to the post-office. In those cruel war-days
everybody went to the post-office. I myself
went regularly to get our mail, and to exchange
shinplasters for one-cent stamps with which to
buy yeast and other commodities that called
for minute fractional currency.</p>

<p>Although I was very fond of Miss Stratford&mdash;I
still recall her gentle eyes, and pretty,
rounded, dark face, in its frame of long, black
curls, with tender liking&mdash;I now coldly resolved
to hurry past, pretending not to know her. It
was a mean thing to do; Miss Stratford had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
always been good to me, shining in that respect
in brilliant contrast to my other teachers, whom
I hated bitterly. Still, the "Kentucky Bear-Hunter-coarse-grain"
was too important a matter
to wait upon any mere female friendships,
and I quickened my pace into a trot, hoping to
scurry by unrecognized.</p>

<p>"Oh, Andrew! is that you?" I heard her call
out as I ran past. For the instant I thought of
rushing on, quite as if I had not heard. Then
I stopped, and walked beside her.</p>

<p>"I am going to stay up all night: mother
says I may; and I am going to fire off Tom
Hemingway's big cannon every fourth time,
straight through till breakfast time," I announced
to her loftily.</p>

<p>"Dear me! I ought to be proud to be seen
walking with such an important citizen," she
answered, with kindly playfulness. She added
more gravely, after a moment's pause: "Then
Tom is out, playing with the other boys, is he?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" I responded. "He always
lets us stand around when he fires off his
cannon. He's got some 'ringers' this year
too."</p>

<p>I heard Miss Stratford murmur an impulsive
"Thank God!" under her breath.</p>

<p>Full as the day had been of surprises, I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
not help wondering that the fact of Tom's ringers
should stir up such profound emotions in
the teacher's breast. Since the subject so interested
her, I went on with a long catalogue
of Tom's other pyrotechnic possessions, and
from that to an account of his almost supernatural
collection of postage-stamps. In a few
minutes more I am sure I should have revealed
to her the great secret of my life, which was
my determination, in case I came to assume the
victorious r&ocirc;le and rank of Napoleon, to immediately
make Tom a Marshal of the Empire.</p>

<p>But we had reached the post-office square.
I had never before seen it so full of people.</p>

<p>Even to my boyish eyes the tragic line of
division which cleft this crowd in twain was
apparent. On one side, over by the Seminary,
the youngsters had lighted a bonfire, and
were running about it&mdash;some of the bolder ones
jumping through it in frolicsome recklessness.
Close by stood the band, now valiantly thumping
out "John Brown's Body" upon the noisy
night air. It was quite dark by this time, but
the musicians knew the tune by heart. So did
the throng about them, and sang it with lusty
fervor. The doors of the saloon toward the corner
of the square were flung wide open. Two
black streams of men kept in motion under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
radiance of the big reflector-lamp over these
doors&mdash;one going in, one coming out. They
slapped one another on the back as they passed,
with exultant screams and shouts. Every once
in awhile, when movement was for the instant
blocked, some voice lifted above the others
would begin "Hip-hip-hip-hip&mdash;" and then
would come a roar that fairly drowned the
music.</p>

<p>On the post-office side of the square there
was no bonfire. No one raised a cheer. A
densely packed mass of men and women stood
in front of the big square stone building, with
its closed doors, and curtained windows upon
which, from time to time, the shadow of
some passing clerk, bareheaded and hurried,
would be momentarily thrown. They waited
in silence for the night mail to be sorted. If
they spoke to one another, it was in whispers&mdash;as
if they had been standing with uncovered
heads at a funeral service in a graveyard. The
dim light reflected over from the bonfire,
or down from the shaded windows of the post-office,
showed solemn, hard-lined, anxious faces.
Their lips scarcely moved when they muttered
little low-toned remarks to their neighbors.
They spoke from the side of the mouth, and
only on one subject.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>"He went all through Fredericksburg without
a scratch&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He looks so much like me&mdash;General Palmer
told my brother he'd have known his hide
in a tan-yard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's been gone&mdash;let's see&mdash;it was a year
some time last April&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was counting on a furlough the first
of this month. I suppose nobody got one as
things turned out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He said, 'No; it ain't my style. I'll
fight as much as you like, but I won't be
nigger-waiter for no man, captain or no captain'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Thus I heard the scattered murmurs among
the grown-up heads above me, as we pushed
into the outskirts of the throng, and stood
there, waiting with the rest. There was no
sentence without a "he" in it. A stranger
might have fancied that they were all talking of
one man. I knew better. They were the
fathers and mothers, the sisters, brothers, wives
of the men whose regiments had been in that
horrible three days' fight at Gettysburg. Each
was thinking and speaking of his own, and took
it for granted the others would understand.
For that matter, they all did understand. The
town knew the name and family of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
one of the twelve-score sons she had in this
battle.</p>

<p>It is not very clear to me now why people
all went to the post-office to wait for the evening
papers that came in from the nearest big
city. Nowadays they would be brought in
bulk and sold on the street before the mailbags
had reached the post-office. Apparently,
that had not yet been thought of in our slow
old town.</p>

<p>The band across the square had started up
afresh with "Annie Lisle"&mdash;the sweet old refrain
of "Wave willows, murmur waters,"
comes back to me now after a quarter-century
of forgetfulness&mdash;when all at once there was a
sharp forward movement of the crowd. The
doors had been thrown open, and the hallway
was on the instant filled with a swarming multitude.
The band had stopped as suddenly as
it began, and no more cheering was heard.
We could see whole troops of dark forms scudding
toward us from the other side of the
square.</p>

<p>"Run in for me&mdash;that's a good boy&mdash;ask
for Dr. Stratford's mail," the teacher whispered,
bending over me.</p>

<p>It seemed an age before I finally got back to
her, with the paper in its postmarked wrapper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
buttoned up inside my jacket. I had never
been in so fierce and determined a crowd before,
and I emerged from it at last, confused in
wits and panting for breath. I was still looking
about through the gloom in a foolish way
for Miss Stratford, when I felt her hand laid
sharply on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;where is it?&mdash;did nothing come?"
she asked, her voice trembling with eagerness,
and the eyes which I had thought so soft and
dove-like flashing down upon me as if she were
Miss Pritchard, and I had been caught chewing
gum in school.</p>

<p>I drew the paper out from under my roundabout,
and gave it to her. She grasped it, and
thrust a finger under the cover to tear it off.
Then she hesitated for a moment, and looked
about her. "Come where there is some
light," she said, and started up the street.
Although she seemed to have spoken more to
herself than to me, I followed her in silence,
close to her side.</p>

<p>For a long way the sidewalk in front of
every lighted store-window was thronged with a
group of people clustered tight about some one
who had a paper, and was reading from it
aloud. Beside broken snatches of this monologue,
we caught, now groans of sorrow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
horror, now exclamations of proud approval,
and even the beginnings of cheers, broken in
upon by a general "'Sh-h!" as we hurried
past outside the curb.</p>

<p>It was under a lamp in the little park nearly
half-way up the hill that Miss Stratford stopped,
and spread the paper open. I see her still,
white-faced, under the flickering gaslight, her
black curls making a strange dark bar between
the pale-straw hat and the white of her shoulder
shawl and muslin dress, her hands trembling as
they held up the extended sheet. She scanned
the columns swiftly, skimmingly for a time, as
I could see by the way she moved her round
chin up and down. Then she came to a part
which called for closer reading. The paper
shook perceptibly now, as she bent her eyes
upon it. Then all at once it fell from her
hands, and without a sound she walked away.</p>

<p>I picked the paper up, and followed her
along the gravelled path. It was like pursuing
a ghost, so weirdly white did her summer attire
now look to my frightened eyes, with such
a swift and deathly silence did she move.
The path upon which we were described a
circle touching the four sides of the square.
She did not quit it when the intersection with
our street was reached, but followed straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
round again toward the point where we had
entered the park. This, too, in turn she
passed, gliding noiselessly forward under the
black arches of the overhanging elms. The
suggestion that she did not know she was going
round and round in a ring startled my brain.
I would have run up to her now if I had
dared.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned, and saw that I was behind
her. She sank slowly into one of the
garden-seats, by the path, and held out for a
moment a hesitating hand toward me. I went
up at this and looked into her face. Shadowed
as it was, the change I saw there chilled my
blood. It was like the face of some one I had
never seen before, with fixed, wide-open, staring
eyes which seemed to look beyond me
through the darkness, upon some terrible sight
no other could see.</p>

<p>"Go&mdash;run and tell&mdash;Tom&mdash;to go home!
His brother&mdash;his brother has been killed," she
said to me, choking over the words as if they
hurt her throat, and still with the same strange
dry-eyed, far-away gaze covering yet not seeing
me.</p>

<p>I held out the paper for her to take, but she
made no sign, and I gingerly laid it on the seat
beside her. I hung about for a minute or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
longer, imagining that she might have something
else to say&mdash;but no word came. Then,
with a feebly inopportune "Well, good-by,"
I started off alone up the hill.</p>

<p>It was a distinct relief to find that my companions
were congregated at the lower end of
the common, instead of their accustomed haunt
farther up near my home, for the walk had been
a lonely one, and I was deeply depressed by
what had happened. Tom, it seems, had been
called away some quarter of an hour before.
All the boys knew of the calamity which had
befallen the Hemingways. We talked about it,
from time to time, as we loaded and fired the
cannon which Tom had obligingly turned over
to my friends. It had been out of deference
to the feelings of the stricken household that
they had betaken themselves and their racket
off to the remote corner of the common. The
solemnity of the occasion silenced criticism
upon my conduct in forgetting to buy the powder.
"There would be enough as long as it
lasted," Billy Norris said, with philosophic decision.</p>

<p>We speculated upon the likelihood of De Witt
Hemingway's being given a military funeral.
These mournful pageants had by this time become
such familiar things to us that the prospect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
of one more had no element of excitement
in it, save as it involved a gloomy sort of distinction
for Tom. He would ride in the first
mourning-carriage with his parents, and this
would associate us, as we walked along ahead
of the band, with the most intimate aspects of
the demonstration. We regretted now that the
soldier company which we had so long projected
remained still unorganized. Had it been otherwise
we would probably have been awarded the
right of the line in the procession. Some one
suggested that it was not too late&mdash;and we
promptly bound ourselves to meet after breakfast
next day to organize and begin drilling.
If we worked at this night and day, and our
parents instantaneously provided us with uniforms
and guns, we should be in time. It was
also arranged that we should be called the
De Witt C. Hemingway Fire Zouaves, and that
Billy Norris should be side captain. The chief
command would, of course, be reserved for
Tom. We would specially salute him as he
rode past in the closed carriage, and then fall in
behind, forming his honorary escort.</p>

<p>None of us had known the dead officer
closely, owing to his advanced age. He was
seven or eight years older than even Tom. But
the more elderly among our group had seen him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
play base-ball in the academy nine, and our
neighborhood was still alive with legends of
his early audacity and skill in collecting barrels
and dry-goods boxes at night for election bonfires.
It was remembered that once he carried
away a whole front-stoop from the house of a
little German tailor on one of the back streets.
As we stood around the heated cannon, in the
great black solitude of the common, our fancies
pictured this redoubtable young man once more
among us&mdash;not in his blue uniform, with crimson
sash and sword laid by his side, and the
gauntlets drawn over his lifeless hands, but as a
taller and glorified Tom, in a roundabout jacket
and copper-toed boots, giving the law on this
his play ground. The very cannon at our feet
had once been his. The night air became peopled
with ghosts of his contemporaries&mdash;handsome
boys who had grown up before us, and
had gone away to lay down their lives in far-off
Virginia or Tennessee.</p>

<p>These heroic shades brought drowsiness in
their train. We lapsed into long silences,
punctuated by yawns, when it was not our turn
to ram and touch off the cannon. Finally some
of us stretched ourselves out on the grass, in the
warm darkness, to wait comfortably for this
turn to come.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>What did come instead was daybreak&mdash;finding
Billy Norris and myself alone constant to
our all-night vow. We sat up and shivered as
we rubbed our eyes. The morning air had
a chilling freshness that went to my bones&mdash;and
these, moreover, were filled with those
novel aches and stiffnesses which beds were
invented to prevent. We stood up, stretching
out our arms, and gaping at the pearl-and-rose
beginnings of the sunrise in the eastern sky.
The other boys had all gone home, and taken
the cannon with them. Only scraps of torn
paper and tiny patches of burnt grass marked
the site of our celebration.</p>

<p>My first weak impulse was to march home
without delay, and get into bed as quickly as
might be. But Billy Norris looked so finely
resolute and resourceful that I hesitated to suggest
this, and said nothing, leaving the initiative
to him. One could see, by the most casual
glance, that he was superior to mere considerations
of unseasonableness in hours. I remembered
now that he was one of that remarkable
body of boys, the paper-carriers, who rose when
all others were asleep in their warm nests, and
trudged about long before breakfast distributing
the <i>Clarion</i> among the well-to-do households.
This fact had given him his position in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
neighborhood as quite the next in leadership
to Tom Hemingway.</p>

<p>He presently outlined his plans to me, after
having tried the centre of light on the horizon,
where soon the sun would be, by an old brass
compass he had in his pocket&mdash;a process which
enabled him, he said, to tell pretty well what
time it was. The paper wouldn't be out for
nearly two hours yet&mdash;and if it were not for the
fact of a great battle, there would have been no
paper at all on this glorious anniversary&mdash;but
he thought we would go down-town and see
what was going on around about the newspaper
office. Forthwith we started. He cheered my
faint spirits by assuring me that I would soon
cease to be sleepy, and would, in fact, feel better
than usual. I dragged my feet along at his
side, waiting for this revival to come, and
meantime furtively yawning against my sleeve.</p>

<p>Billy seemed to have dreamed a good deal,
during our nap on the common, about the De
Witt C. Hemingway Fire Zouaves. At least he
had now in his head a marvellously elaborated
system of organization, which he unfolded as we
went along. I felt that I had never before realized
his greatness, his born genius for command.
His scheme halted nowhere. He allotted offices
with discriminating firmness; he treated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
question of uniforms and guns as a trivial detail
which would settle itself; he spoke with calm
confidence of our offering our services to the
Republic in the autumn; his clear vision was
even the materials for a fife-and-drum corps
among the German boys in the back streets. It
was true that I appeared personally to play a
meagre part in these great projects; the most
that was said about me was that I might make a
fair third-corporal. But Fate had thrown in my
way such a wonderful chance of becoming intimate
with Billy that I made sure I should swiftly
advance in rank&mdash;the more so as I discerned in
the background of his thoughts, as it were, a
grim determination to make short work of Tom
Hemingway's aristocratic pretensions, once the
funeral was over.</p>

<p>We were forced to make a detour of the park
on our way down, because Billy observed some
half-dozen Irish boys at play with a cannon inside,
whom he knew to be hostile. If there had
been only four, he said, he would have gone in
and routed them. He could whip any two of
them, he added, with one hand tied behind his
back. I listened with admiration. Billy was
not tall, but he possessed great thickness of chest
and length of arm. His skin was so dark that
we canvassed the theory from time to time of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
having Indian blood. He did not discourage
this, and he admitted himself that he was double-jointed.</p>

<p>The streets of the business part of the town,
into which we now made our way, were quite
deserted. We went around into the yard behind
the printing-office, where the carrier-boys were
wont to wait for the press to get to work; and
Billy displayed some impatience at discovering
that here too there was no one. It was now
broad daylight, but through the windows of the
composing-room we could see some of the printers
still setting type by kerosene lamps.</p>

<p>We seated ourselves at the end of the yard on
a big, flat, smooth-faced stone, and Billy produced
from his pocket a number of "em" quads,
so he called them, and with which the carriers
had learned from the printers' boys to play a
very beautiful game. You shook the pieces of
metal in your hands and threw them on the
stone; your score depended upon the number of
nicked sides that were turned uppermost. We
played this game in the interest of good-fellowship
for a little. Then Billy told me that the
carriers always played it for pennies, and that it
was unmanly for us to do otherwise. He had no
pennies at that precise moment, but would pay
at the end of the week what he had lost; in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
meantime there was my twenty cents to go on
with. After this Billy threw so many nicks
uppermost that my courage gave way, and I
made an attempt to stop the game; but a single
remark from him as to the military destiny
which he was reserving for me, if I only displayed
true soldierly nerve and grit, sufficed to quiet me
once more, and the play went on. I had now
only five cents left.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shadow interposed itself between
the sunlight and the stone. I looked up, to behold
a small boy with bare arms and a blackened
apron standing over me, watching our game.
There was a great deal of ink on his face and
hands, and a hardened, not to say rakish expression
in his eye.</p>

<p>"Why don't you 'jeff' with somebody of
your own size?" he demanded of Billy, after
having looked me over critically.</p>

<p>He was not nearly-so big as Billy, and I expected
to see the latter instantly rise and crush
him, but Billy only laughed and said we were
playing for fun; he was going to give me all my
money back. I was rejoiced to hear this, but
still felt surprised at the propitiatory manner
Billy adopted toward this diminutive inky boy.
It was not the demeanor befitting aside-captain&mdash;and
what made it worse was that the strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
boy loftily declined to be cajoled by it. He
sniffed when Billy told him about the military
company we were forming; he coldly shook his
head, with a curt "Nixie!" when invited to
join it; and he laughed aloud at hearing the
name our organization was to bear.</p>

<p>"He ain't dead at all&mdash;that De Witt Hemingway,"
he said, with jeering contempt.</p>

<p>"Hain't he though!" exclaimed Billy.
"The news come last night. Tom had to go
home&mdash;his mother sent for him&mdash;on account of
it!"</p>

<p>"I'll bet you a quarter he ain't dead," responded
the practical inky boy. "Money up,
though!"</p>

<p>"I've only got fifteen cents. I'll bet you
that, though," rejoined Billy, producing my
torn and dishevelled shinplasters.</p>

<p>"All right! Wait here!" said the boy,
running off to the building and disappearing
through the door. There was barely time for me
to learn from my companion that this printer's
apprentice was called "the devil," and could
not only whistle between his teeth and crack
his fingers, but chew tobacco, when he reappeared,
with a long narrow strip of paper in his
hand. This he held out for us to see, indicating
with an ebon forefinger the special paragraph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
we were to read. Billy looked at it
sharply, for several moments, in silence. Then
he said to me: "What does it say there?
I must' a' got some powder in my eyes last
night."</p>

<p>I read this paragraph aloud, not without an
unworthy feeling that the inky boy would now
respect me deeply:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smcap">Correction.</span> Lieutenant De Witt C.
Hemingway, of Company A, &mdash;&mdash;th New York,
reported in earlier despatches among the killed,
is uninjured. The officer killed is Lieutenant
Carl Heinninge, Company F, same regiment."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Billy's face visibly lengthened as I read this
out, and he felt us both looking at him. He
made a pretence of examining the slip of paper
again, but in a half-hearted way. Then he
ruefully handed over the fifteen cents and,
rising from the stone, shook himself.</p>

<p>"Them Dutchmen never was no good!"
was what he said.</p>

<p>The inky boy had put the money in the
pocket under his apron, and grinned now with
as much enjoyment as dignity would permit
him to show. He did not seem to mind any
longer the original source of his winnings, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
it was apparent that I could not with decency
recall it to him. Some odd impulse prompted
me, however, to ask him if I might have the
paper he had in his hand. He was magnanimous
enough to present me with the proof-sheet
on the spot. Then with another grin he turned
and left us.</p>

<p>Billy stood sullenly kicking with his bare
toes into a sand-heap by the stone. He would
not answer me when I spoke to him. It flashed
across my perceptive faculties that he was not
such a great man, after all, as I had imagined.
In another instant or two it had become quite
clear to me that I had no admiration for him
whatever. Without a word, I turned on my
heel and walked determinedly out of the yard
and into the street, homeward bent.</p>

<p>All at once I quickened my pace; something
had occurred to me. The purpose thus conceived
grew so swiftly that soon I found myself
running. Up the hill I sped, and straight
through the park. If the Irish boys shouted
after me I knew it not, but dashed on heedless
of all else save the one idea. I only halted,
breathless and panting, when I stood on Dr.
Stratford's doorstep, and heard the night-bell
inside jangling shrilly in response to my excited
pull.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>As I waited, I pictured to myself the old
doctor as he would presently come down, half-dressed
and pulling on his coat as he advanced.
He would ask, eagerly, "Who is sick? Where
am I to go?" and I would calmly reply that he
unduly alarmed himself, and that I had a message
for his daughter. He would, of course,
ask me what it was, and I, politely but firmly,
would decline to explain to any one but the
lady in person. Just what might ensue was not
clear&mdash;but I beheld myself throughout commanding
the situation, at once benevolent,
polished, and inexorable.</p>

<p>The door opened with unlooked-for promptness,
while my self-complacent vision still hung
in mid-air. Instead of the bald and spectacled
old doctor, there confronted me a white-faced,
solemn-eyed lady in a black dress, whom I did
not seem to know. I stared at her, tongue-tied,
till she said, in a low, grave voice,
"Well, Andrew, what is it?"</p>

<p>Then of course I saw that it was Miss Stratford,
my teacher, the person whom I had come
to see. Some vague sense of what the sleepless
night had meant in this house came to me as I
gazed confusedly at her mourning, and heard
the echo of her sad tones in my ears.</p>

<p>"Is some one ill?" she asked again.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>"No; some one&mdash;some one is very well!"
I managed to reply, lifting my eyes again to
her wan face. The spectacle of its drawn lines
and pallor all at once assailed my wearied and
overtaxed nerves with crushing weight. I felt
myself beginning to whimper, and rushing tears
scalded my eyes. Something inside my breast
seemed to be dragging me down through the
stoop.</p>

<p>I have now only the recollection of Miss
Stratford's kneeling by my side, with a supporting
arm around me, and of her thus unrolling
and reading the proof-paper I had in my
hand. We were in the hall now, instead of on
the stoop, and there was a long silence. Then
she put her head on my shoulder and wept. I
could hear and feel her sobs as if they were my
own.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't think you'd cry&mdash;that you'd
be so sorry," I heard myself saying, at last, in
despondent self-defence.</p>

<p>Miss Stratford lifted her head and, still
kneeling as she was, put a finger under my chin
to make me look her in her face. Lo! the
eyes were laughing through their tears; the
whole countenance was radiant once more with
the light of happy youth and with that other
glory which youth knows only once.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183&ndash;184</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Andrew, boy," she said, trembling,
smiling, sobbing, beaming all at once, "didn't
you know that people cry for very joy sometimes?"</p>

<p>And as I shook my head she bent down and
kissed me.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">I held</span> the lamp, while Aunt Susan cut up
the pig.</p>

<p>The whole day had been devoted, I remember,
to preparations for this great event. Early
in the morning I had been to the butcher's to
set in train the annual negotiations for a loan
of cleaver and meat-saw; and hours afterward
had borne these implements proudly homeward
through the village street. In the interval I
had turned the grindstone, over at the Four
Corners, while the grocer's hired man obligingly
sharpened our carving-knife. Then there
had been the even more back-aching task of
clearing away the hard snow from the accustomed
site of our wood-pile in the yard, and
scraping together a frosted heap of chips and
bark for the smudge in the smoke-barrel.</p>

<p>From time to time I sweetened this toil, and
helped the laggard hours to a swifter pace, by
paying visits to the woodshed to have still
another look at the pig. He was frozen very
stiff, and there were small icicles in the crevices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
whence his eyes had altogether disappeared.
My emotions as I viewed his big, cold, pink
carcass, with its extended legs, its bland and
pasty countenance, and that awful emptiness
underneath, were much mixed. Although I
was his elder by seven or eight years, we had
been close friends during all his life&mdash;or all except
a very few weeks of his earliest sucking
pighood, spent on his native farm. I had fed
him daily; I had watched him grow week by
week; more than once I had poked him with
a stick as he ran around in his sty, to make
him squeal for the edification of neighbors'
boys who had come into our yard, and would
now be sharply ordered out again by Aunt
Susan.</p>

<p>As these kindly memories surged over me I
could not but feel like a traitor to my old companion,
as he lay thus hairless and pallid before
my eyes. But then I would remember how
good he was going to be to eat&mdash;and straightway
return with a light heart to the work of
kicking up more chips from the ice.</p>

<p>From the living-room in the rear of our little
house came the monotonous incessant clatter of
Aunt Susan's carpet loom. Through the window
I could see the outlines of her figure and
the back of her head as she sat on her high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
bench. It was to me the most familiar of all
spectacles, this tireless woman bending resolutely
over her work. She was there when I
first cautiously ventured my nose out from under
the warm blanket of a winter's morning.
Very, very often I fell asleep at night in my
bed in the recess, lulled off by the murmur of
the diligent loom.</p>

<p>Presently I went in to warm myself, and
stood with my red fingers over the stove top.
She cast but one vague glance at me, through
the open frame of the loom between us, and
went on with her work. It was not our habit
to talk much in that house. She was too busy
a woman, for one thing, to have much time for
conversation. The impression that she preferred
not to talk was always present in my
boyish mind. I call up the picture of her still
as I saw her then under the top bar of the cumbrous
old machine, sitting with lips tight together,
and resolute, masterful eyes bent upon
the twining intricacy of warp and woof before
her. At her side were piled a dozen or more
big balls of carpet rags, which the village wives
and daughters cut up, sewed together and
wound in the long winter evenings, while
the men-folks sat with their stockinged feet
on the stove hearth, and read out the latest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
"news from the front" in their <i>Weekly
Tribune</i>.</p>

<p>I knew all these rag balls by the names of
their owners. Not only did I often go to their
houses for them, upon the strength of the general
village rumor that they were ready, and always
carry back the finished lengths of carpet;
but I had long since unconsciously grown to
watch all the varying garments and shifts of
fashion in the raiment of our neighbors, with
an eye single to the likelihood of their eventually
turning up at Aunt Susan's loom. When
Hiram Mabie's checkered butternut coat was
cut down for his son Roswell, I noted the fact
merely as a stage of its progress toward carpet
rags. If Mrs. Wilkins concluded to turn her
flowered delaine dress a third year, or Sarah
Northrup had her bright saffron shawl dyed
black, I was sensible of a wrong having been
done our little household. I felt like crossing
the street whenever I saw approaching the
portly figure of Cyrus Husted's mother, the
woman who dragged everybody into her house
to show them the ingrain carpet she had bought
at Tecumseh, and assured them that it was
much cheaper in the long run than the products
of my Aunt's industry. I tingled with indignation
as she passed me on the sidewalk, puffing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
for breath and stepping mincingly because her
shoes were too tight for her.</p>

<p>Nearly all the knowledge of our neighbors'
sayings and doings which reached Aunt Susan
came to her from me. She kept herself to herself
with a vengeance, toiling early and late,
rarely going beyond the confines of her yard
save on Sunday mornings, when we went to
church, and treating with frosty curtness the
few people who ventured to come to our house
on business or from social curiosity. For one
thing, this Juno Mills in which we lived was
not really our home. We had only been there
for four or five years&mdash;a space which indeed
spanned all my recollections of life&mdash;but left
my Aunt more or less a stranger and new-comer.
She spared no pains to maintain that condition.
I can see now that there were good reasons for
this stern aloofness. At the time I thought it
was altogether due to the proud and unsociable
nature of my Aunt.</p>

<p>In my child's mind I regarded her as distinctly
an elderly person. People outside, I
know, spoke of her as an old maid, sometimes
winking furtively over my head as they did so.
But she was not really old at all&mdash;was in truth
just barely in the thirties. Doubtless the fact
that she was tall and dark, with very black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
hair, and that years of steady concentration of
sight, upon the strings and threads of the loom,
had scored a scowling vertical wrinkle between
her near-sighted eyes gave me my notion of
her advanced maturity. And in all her ways
and words, too, she was so far removed from
any idea of youthful softness! I could not remember
her having ever kissed me. My imagination
never evolved the conceit of her kissing
anybody. I had always had at her hands
uniformly good treatment, good food, good
clothes; after I had learned my letters from
the old maroon plush label on the Babbitt's
soap box which held the wood behind the
stove, and expanded this knowledge by a study
of street signs, she had herself taught me how
to read, and later provided me with books for
the village school. She was my only known
relative&mdash;the only person in the world who had
ever done anything for me. Yet it could not
be said that I loved her. Indeed she no more
raised the suggestion of tenderness in my mind
than did the loom at which she spent her waking
hours.</p>

<p>"The Perkinses asked me why you didn't
get the butcher to cut up the pig," I remarked
at last, rubbing my hands together over the
hot stove griddles.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>"It's none of their business!" said Aunt
Susan, with laconic promptness.</p>

<p>"And Devillo Pollard's got a new overcoat,"
I added. "He hasn't worn the old army one
now for upward of a week."</p>

<p>"If this war goes on much longer," commented
my Aunt, "every carpet in Dearborn
County 'll be as blue as a whetstone."</p>

<p>I think that must have been the entire conversation
of the afternoon. I especially recall
the remark about the overcoat. For two years
now the balls of rags had contained an increasing
proportion of pale blue woollen strips, as
the men of the country round about came home
from the South, or bought cheap garments from
the second-hand dealers in Tecumseh. All
other colors had died out. There was only
this light blue, and the black of bombazine or
worsted mourning into which the news in each
week's papers forced one or another of the
neighboring families. To obviate this monotony,
some of the women dyed their white
rags with butternut or even cochineal, but this
was a mere drop in the bucket, so to speak.
The loom spun out only long, depressing rolls
of black and blue.</p>

<p>My memory leaps lightly forward now to
the early evening, when I held the lamp in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
the woodshed, and Aunt Susan cut up the
pig.</p>

<p>How joyfully I watched her every operation!
Every now and again my interest grew so
beyond proper bounds that I held the lamp
sidewise, and the flame smoked the chimney. I
was in mortal terror over this lamp, even when
it was standing on the table quite by itself.
We often read in the paper of explosions from
this new kerosene by which people were
instantly killed and houses wrapped in an unquenchable
fire. Aunt Susan had stood out
against the strange invention, long after most
of the other homes of Juno Mills were familiar
with the idea of the lamp. Even after she had
yielded, and I went to the grocery for more oil
and fresh chimneys and wicks, like other boys,
she refused to believe that this inflammable fluid
was really squeezed out of hard coal, as they
said. And for years we lived in momentary belief
that our lamp was about to explode.</p>

<p>My fears of sudden death could not, however,
for a moment stand up against the delighted
excitement with which I viewed the dismemberment
of the pig. It was very cold in
the shed, but neither of us noticed that. My
Aunt attacked the job with skilful resolution
and energy, as was her way, chopping small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
bones, sawing vehemently through big ones,
hacking and slicing with the knife, like a
strong man in a hurry.</p>

<p>For a long time no word was spoken. I
gazed in silence as the head was detached, and
then resolved itself slowly into souse&mdash;always
tacitly set aside as my special portion. In
prophecy I saw the big pan, filled with ears,
cheeks, snout, feet, and tail, all boiled and
allowed to grow cold in their own jelly&mdash;that
pan to which I was free to repair any time of day
until everything was gone. I thought of myself,
too, with apron tied round my neck and
the chopping-bowl on my knees, reducing what
remained of the head into small bits, to be
seasoned by my Aunt, and then fill other pans
as head-cheese. The sage and summer savory
hung in paper flour-bags from the rafters overhead.
I looked up at them with rapture. It
seemed as if my mouth already tasted them in
head-cheese and sausage and in the hot gravy
which basted the succulent spare-rib. Only the
abiding menace of the lamp kept me from dancing
with delight.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, as my Aunt passed from
the tid-bits to the more substantial portions of
her task, getting out the shoulders, the hams
for smoking, the pieces for salting down in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
brine-barrel, my enthusiasm languished a trifle.
The lamp grew heavy as I changed it from
hand to hand, holding the free fingers at a respectful
distance over the chimney-top for
warmth, and shuffling my feet about. It was
truly very cold. I strove to divert myself by
smiling at the big shadow my bustling Aunt
cast against the house side of the shed, and by
moving the lamp to affect its proportions, but
broke out into yawns instead. A mouse ran
swiftly across the scantling just under the
lean-to roof. At the same time I thought I
caught the muffled sound of distant rapping, as
if at our own rarely used front door. I was
too sleepy to decide whether I had really heard
a noise or not.</p>

<p>All at once I roused myself with a start.
The lamp had nearly slipped from my hands,
and the horror of what might have happened
frightened me into wakefulness.</p>

<p>"The Perkins girls keep on calling me 'Wise
child.' They yell it after me all the while,"
I said, desperately clutching at a subject which
I hoped would interest my Aunt. I had spoken
to her about it a week or so before, and it
had stirred her quite out of her wonted stern
calm. If anything would induce her to talk
now, it would be this.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>"They do, eh?" she said, with an alert
sharpness of voice, which dwindled away into
a sigh. Then, after a moment, she added,
"Well, never you mind. You just keep right
on, tending to your own affairs, and studying
your lessons, and in time it'll be you who can
laugh at them and all their low-down lot.
They only do it to make you feel bad. Just
don't you humor them."</p>

<p>"But I don't see," I went on, "why&mdash;what
do they call me 'wise child' <i>for</i>? I
asked Hi Budd, up at the Corners, but he only
just chuckled and chuckled to himself, and
wouldn't say a word."</p>

<p>My Aunt suspended work for the moment,
and looked severely down upon me. "Well!
Ira Clarence Blodgett!" she said, with grim
emphasis, "I am ashamed of you! I thought
you had more pride! The idea of talking
about things like that with a coarse, rough,
hired man&mdash;in a barn!"</p>

<p>To hear my full name thus pronounced, syllable
by syllable, sent me fairly weltering, as it
were, under Aunt Susan's utmost condemnation.
It was the punishment reserved for my gravest
crimes. I hung my head, and felt the lamp
wagging nervelessly in my hands. I could not
deny even her speculative impeachment as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
the barn; it was blankly apparent in my mind
that the fact of the barn made matters much
worse.</p>

<p>"I was helping him wash their two-seated
sleigh," I submitted, weakly. "He asked me
to."</p>

<p>"What does that matter?" she asked, peremptorily.
"What business have you got
going around talking with men about me?"</p>

<p>"Why, it wasn't about you at all, Aunt
Susan," I put in more confidently. "I said the
Perkins girls kept calling me 'wise child,'
and I asked Hi&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Aunt Susan sighed once more, and interrupted
me to inspect the wick of the lamp.
Then she turned again to her work, but less
spiritedly now. She took up the cleaver with
almost an air of sadness.</p>

<p>"You don't understand&mdash;yet," she said.
"But don't make it any harder for me by talking.
Just go along and say nothing to nobody.
People will think more of you."</p>

<p>My mind strove in vain to grapple with this
suggested picture of myself, moving about in
perpetual dumbness, followed everywhere by
universal admiration. The lamp would <i>not</i> hold
itself straight.</p>

<p>All at once we both distinctly heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
sound of footsteps close outside. The noise of
crunching on the dry, frozen snow came through
the thin clap-boards with sharp resonance.
Aunt Susan ceased cutting and listened.</p>

<p>"I heard somebody rapping at the front door
a spell ago," I ventured to whisper. My Aunt
looked at me, and probably realized that I was
too sleepy to be accountable for my actions. At
all events she said nothing, but moved toward
the low door of the shed, cleaver in hand.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" she called out in shrill,
belligerent tones; and this demand she repeated,
after an interval of silence, when an irresolute
knocking was heard on the door.</p>

<p>We heard a man coughing immediately outside
the door. I saw Aunt Susan start at the
sound&mdash;almost as if she recognized it. A
moment later this man, whoever he was, mastered
his cough sufficiently to call out, in a hesitating
way:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Susan?"</p>

<p>Aunt Susan raised her chin on the instant,
her nostrils drawn in, her eyes flashing like
those of a pointer when he sees a gun lifted. I
had never seen her so excited. She wheeled
round once, and covered me with a swift, penetrating,
comprehensive glance, under which
my knees smote together, and the lamp lurched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
perilously. Then she turned again, glided
toward the door, halted, moved backward two
or three steps&mdash;looked again at me, and this
time spoke.</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>swan</i>!" was what she said, and I
felt that she looked it.</p>

<p>"Susan! Is that you?" came the voice
again, hoarsely appealing. It was not the voice
of any neighbor. I made sure I had never
heard it before. I could have smiled to myself
at the presumption of any man calling my
Aunt by her first name, if I had not been too
deeply mystified.</p>

<p>"I've been directed here to find Miss Susan
Pike," the man outside explained, between
fresh coughings.</p>

<p>"Well, then, mog your boots out of this as
quick as ever you can!" my Aunt replied,
with great promptitude. "You won't find her
here!"</p>

<p>"But I <i>have</i> found her!" the stranger protested,
with an accent of wearied deprecation.
"Don't you know me, Susan? I am not
strong, this cold air is very bad for me."</p>

<p>"I say 'get out!'" my Aunt replied, sharply.
Her tone was unrelenting enough, but I noted
that she had tipped her head a little to one
side, a clear sign to me that she was opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
her mind to argument. I felt certain that
presently I should see this man.</p>

<p>And, sure enough, after some further parley,
Susan went to the door, and, with a half-defiant
gesture, knocked the hook up out of the
staple.</p>

<p>"Come along then, if you must!" she said,
in scornful tones. Then she marched back till
she stood beside me, angry resolution written
all over her face and the cleaver in her hand.</p>

<p>A tall, dark figure, opaque against a gleaming
background of moonlight and snowlight,
was what I for a moment saw in the frame of
the open doorway. Then, as he entered, shut
and hooked the door behind him, and stood
looking in a dazed way over at our lamplit
group, I saw that he was a slender, delicately
featured man, with a long beard of yellowish
brown and gentle eyes. He was clad as a
soldier, heavy azure-hued caped overcoat and
all, and I already knew enough of uniforms&mdash;cruel
familiarity of my war-time infancy&mdash;to
tell by his cap that he was an officer. He
coughed again before a word was spoken He
looked the last man in the world to go about
routing up peaceful households of a winter's
night.</p>

<p>"Well, now&mdash;what is your business?" demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Aunt Susan. She put her hand on my
shoulder as she spoke, something I had never
known her to do before. I felt confused under
this novel caress, and it seemed only natural that
the stranger, having studied my Aunt's face in
a wistful way for a moment, should turn his
gaze upon me. I was truly a remarkable object,
with Aunt Susan's hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"I could make no one hear at the other door.
I saw the light through the window here, and
came around," the stranger explained. He
sent little straying glances at the remains of the
pig and at the weapon my Aunt held at her
side, but for the most part looked steadily at
me.</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter," said Aunt Susan,
coldly. "What do you want, now that you
<i>are</i> here? Why did you come at all? What
business had you to think that I ever wanted to
lay eyes on you again? How could you have
the courage to show your face here&mdash;in <i>my</i>
house?"</p>

<p>The man's shoulders shivered under their
cape, and a wan smile curled in his beard.
"You keep your house at a very low temperature,"
he said with grave pleasantry. He did
not seem to mind Aunt Susan's hostile demeanor
at all.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>"I was badly wounded last September," he
went on, quite as if that was what she had
asked him, "and lay at the point of death for
weeks. Then they sent me North, and I have
been in the hospital at Albany ever since. One
of the nurses there, struck by my name, asked me
if I had any relatives in her village&mdash;that is, Juno
Mills. In that way I learned where you were
living. I suppose I ought not to have come&mdash;against
doctor's orders&mdash;the journey has been
too much&mdash;I have suffered a good deal these
last two hours."</p>

<p>I felt my Aunt's hand shake a little on my
shoulder. Her voice, though, was as implacable
as ever.</p>

<p>"There is a much better reason than that
why you should not have come," she said, bitterly.</p>

<p>The stranger was talking to her, but looking
at me. He took a step toward me now,
with a softened sparkle in his eyes and an outstretched
hand. "This&mdash;this then is the boy,
is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>With a gesture of amazing swiftness Aunt
Susan threw her arm about me, and drew me
close to her side, lamp and all. With her
other hand she lifted and almost brandished
the cleaver.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>"No, you don't!" she cried. "You don't
touch him! He's mine! I've worked for
him day and night ever since I took him from
his dying mother's breast. I closed her eyes.
I forgave her. Blood is thicker'n water after all.
She was my sister. Yes, I forgave poor Emmeline,
and I kissed her before she died. She
gave the boy to me, and he's mine! Mine, do
you hear?&mdash;<i>mine?</i>"</p>

<p>"My dear Susan&mdash;&mdash;" our visitor began.</p>

<p>"Don't 'dear Susan' me! I heard it once&mdash;once
too often. Oh, never again! You left
me to run away with her. I don't speak of
that. I forgave that when I forgave her. But
that was the least of it. You left her to herself
for months before she died. You've left the
boy to himself ever since. You can't begin
now. I've worked my fingers to the bone for
him&mdash;you can't make me stop now."</p>

<p>"I went to California," he went on in a low
voice, speaking with difficulty. "We didn't
get on together as smoothly as we might perhaps,
but I had no earthly notion of deserting
her. I was ill myself, lying in yellow-fever
quarantine off Key West, at the very time she
died. When I finally got back you and the
child were both gone. I could not trace you.
I went to the war. I had made money in California.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
It is trebled now. I rose to be Colonel&mdash;I
have a Brigadier's brevet in my pocket
now. Yet I give you my word I never have
desired anything so much, all the time, as to
find you again&mdash;you and the boy."</p>

<p>My Aunt nodded her head comprehendingly.
I felt from the tremor of her hand that she was
forcing herself against her own desires to be
disagreeable.</p>

<p>"Yes, that war," was what she said. "I
know about that war! The honest men that
go get killed. But you&mdash;<i>you</i> come back!"</p>

<p>The man frowned wearily, and gave a little
groan of discouragement. "Then this is final,
is it? You don't wish to speak with me; you
really desire to keep the boy&mdash;you are set against
my ever seeing him&mdash;touching him. Why,
then, of course&mdash;of course&mdash;excuse my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then for the first time I saw a human
being tumble in a dead swoon. My little brain,
dazed and bewildered by the strange new things
I was hearing, lagged behind my eyes in following
the sudden pallor on the man's face&mdash;lagged
behind my ears in noting the tell-tale quaver
and gasp in his voice. Before I comprehended
what was toward&mdash;lo! there was no man standing
in front of me at all.</p>

<p>Like a flash Aunt Susan snatched the lamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
from my grasp and flung herself upon her
knees beside the limp and huddled figure.
After a momentary inspection of the white,
bearded face, she set the lamp down on the
frozen earth floor and took his head upon her
lap.</p>

<p>"Take the lamp, run to the buttery, and
bring the bottle of hartshorn!" she commanded
me, hurriedly. "Or, no&mdash;wait&mdash;open the
door&mdash;that's it&mdash;walk ahead with the light!"</p>

<p>The strong woman stood upright as she spoke,
her shoulders braced against the burden she
bore in her arms. Unaided, with slow steps,
she carried the senseless form of the soldier into
the living room, and held it without rest of any
sort, the while I, under her direction, wildly
tore off quilts, blankets, sheets, and feather-tick
from my bed and heaped them up on the floor
beside the stove. Then, when I had spread
them to her liking, she bent and gently laid
him down.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i> get the hartshorn," she said. I heard
her putting more wood on the fire, but when I
returned with the phial she sat once again with
the stranger's head upon her knee. She was
softly stroking the fine, waving brown hair upon
his brow, but her eyes were lifted, looking
dreamily at far-away things. I could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
sworn to the beginnings of a smile about her
parted lips. It was not like my Aunt Susan at
all.</p>

<p>"Come here, Ira," I heard her say at last,
after a long time had been spent in silence. I
walked over and stood at her shoulder, looking
down upon the pale face upturned against the
black of her worn dress. The blue veins just
discernible in temples and closed eyelids, the
delicately turned features, the way his brown
beard curled, the fact that his breathing was
gently regular once more&mdash;these are what I saw.
But my Aunt seemed to demand that I should
see more.</p>

<p>"Well?" she asked, in a tone mellowed
beyond all recognition. "Don't you&mdash;don't
you see who it is?"</p>

<p>I suppose I really must have had an idea by
this time. But I remember that I shook my
head.</p>

<p>My Aunt positively did smile this time.
"The Perkins girls were wrong," she said;
"there isn't the least smitch of a 'wise child'
about <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>There was another pause. Emboldened by
consciousness of a change in the emotional
atmosphere, I was moved to lay my hand upon
my Aunt's shoulder. The action did not seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
to displease her, and we remained thus for some
minutes, watching together this strange addition
to our family party.</p>

<p>Finally she told me to get on my cap, comforter,
and mittens, and run over to Dr. Peabody's
and fetch him back with me. The purport
of my mission oppressed me.</p>

<p>"Is he going to die then?" I asked.</p>

<p>Aunt Susan laughed outright. "You little
goose," she said; "do you think the doctors
kill people <i>every</i> time?"</p>

<p>And, laughing again, with a trembling softness
in her voice and tears upon her black eyelashes,
she lifted her face to mine&mdash;and kissed
me!</p>

</div>

<p>No fatality dogged good old Doctor Peabody's
big footsteps through the snow that
night. I fell asleep while he was still at my
Aunt's house, but not before the stranger had
recovered consciousness, and was sitting up in
the large rocking-chair, and it was clearly understood
that he was soon to be well again.</p>

<p>The kindly, garrulous doctor did more than
reassure our little household. He must have
spent most of the night going about reassuring
the other households of Juno Mills. At all
events, when I first went out next morning&mdash;while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
our neighbors were still eating their buckwheat
cakes and pork fat by lamplight&mdash;everybody
seemed to know that my father, the distinguished
Colonel Blodgett, had returned from
the war on sick leave, and was lying ill at the
house of his sister-in-law. I felt at once the
altered attitude of the village toward me. Important
citizens who had never spoken to me
before&mdash;dignified and portly men in blue cutaway
coats with brass buttons, and high stiff
hats of shaggy white silk&mdash;stopped now to lay
their hands on the top of my head and ask me
how my father, the Colonel, was getting along.
The grocer's hired man gave me a Jackson ball
and two molasses cookies the very first time I
saw him. Even the Perkins girls, during the
course of the afternoon, strolled over to our
front gate, and, instead of hurling enigmatic
objurgations at me, invited me to come out and
play. The butcher of his own accord came and
finished cutting up the pig.</p>

<p>These changes came back to me as one part
of the great metamorphosis which the night's
events had wrought. Another part was the
definite disappearance of the stern-faced, tirelessly
toiling old maid I had known all my life
as Aunt Susan. In her place there was now a
much younger woman, with pleasant lines about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
her pretty mouth, and eyes that twinkled when
they looked at me, and who paid no attention
to the loom whatever, but bustled cheerily
about the house instead, thinking only of good
things for us to eat.</p>

<p>I remember that I marked my sense of the
difference by abandoning the old name of Aunt
Susan, and calling her now just "Auntie."
And one day, in the mid-spring, after she and
her convalescent patient had returned from their
first drive together into the country round
about, she told me, as she took off her new bonnet
in an absent-minded way, and looked meditatively
at the old disused loom, and then bent
down to brush my forehead with her warm lips&mdash;she
told me that henceforth I was to call her
Mother.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
